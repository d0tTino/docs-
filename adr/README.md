# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains architecture decision records (ADRs) for the project.

ADRs are numbered sequentially starting at 0001. Files use a zero-padded
four-digit prefix followed by a short name, for example:

```
0001-use-mkdocs.md
0002-add-search-plugin.md
```

Numbers are never reused. Once an ADR is written, its file name and number
remain stable even if the decision is superseded.
