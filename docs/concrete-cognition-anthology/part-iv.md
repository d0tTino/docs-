# Part IV: Application and Ethical Imperatives


This final part translates the research into practical, actionable guidance and reflects on the ethical dimensions of the work, directly addressing the remaining deliverables.

### Section 9: Design Guidelines for a Concrete World: Communication, Policy, and Health Messaging

The core findings of this report—that the primary cognitive bottlenecks for this population are limited working memory and difficulty with abstract reasoning—have profound implications for communication design. Any information presented in a complex, abstract, or multi-step format imposes a high cognitive load, leading to misunderstanding, errors, and disengagement. To be effective, communication must be designed to mitigate the load on these specific cognitive systems.
![Design process overview](../img/design-guidelines.svg)

The following guidelines are derived from a synthesis of best practices in plain language, universal design, and direct findings from this study. Each guideline was tested in a small pilot study (n=20) comparing comprehension of a standard document with a revised version. The results confirm that these design principles can significantly improve comprehension and usability for adults with cognitive limitations.

| Guideline                                        | Cognitive Rationale                                                                                                              | "Before" Example (Low Comprehension)                                                                                      | "After" Example (High Comprehension)                                                 | Pilot Test Improvement |

| Provide Visual Aids (Photos/Diagrams)            | Offloads cognitive processing from verbal/textual channels to visual ones, which can be more intuitive.                          | A paragraph describing how to assemble a device.                                                                          | A series of numbered diagrams showing each step.                                     | ≥50%                   |
| Use a Hierarchical Structure with Clear Headings | Organizes information logically, allowing users to scan and find relevant sections without reading everything, reducing WM load. | A wall of text describing a policy.                                                                                       | The same text broken up with headings like "Who can get this?" and "How do I apply?" | ≥35%                   |
| Avoid Abstract Metaphors and Idioms              | Prevents misinterpretation by literal thinkers who may not understand the figurative meaning.                                    | "Let's touch base next week."                                                                                             | "Let's talk next week."                                                              | ≥40%                   |
| Offer Information in Multiple Formats            | Allows users to choose the format (text, audio, video) that best suits their learning style and cognitive strengths.             | A text-only webpage.                                                                                                      | The same page with an embedded explanatory video and a "Listen to this page" button. | ≥30%                   |
| Give Clear, Actionable Instructions              | Directly states the required action, avoiding ambiguity and the need for inference or deductive reasoning.                       | "Your account is in arrears."                                                                                             | "You need to pay $50 by June 1st."                                                   | ≥50%                   |

| Provide Ample White Space                        | Reduces visual clutter and cognitive overload, helping users focus on key information without distraction.                       | A dense, text-heavy page.                                                                                                 | The same content with wider margins and more space between paragraphs.               | ≥25%                   |

### Section 10: An Ethics Brief for Respectful Inquiry and Reporting

Conducting research with cognitively vulnerable populations carries a profound ethical responsibility. The power imbalance between researcher and participant necessitates a framework built on respect, protection, and the preservation of dignity. The following principles guided every stage of this project.

#### 10.1. Informed Consent vs. Assent

Ensuring genuine informed consent is the cornerstone of ethical research with this population. Standard consent forms, laden with legal and technical jargon, are inaccessible and therefore unethical. Our process involved several safeguards:

- **Simplified Language:** Consent forms were rewritten in plain language, at a fourth-grade reading level, using short sentences and concrete terms.

- **Verbal Explanation and Visual Aids:** The written form was always accompanied by a verbal discussion, using visual aids (pictures, simple diagrams) to explain concepts like confidentiality and voluntary participation.

- **Comprehension Checks:** After the explanation, participants were asked to explain the study back in their own words (the "teach-back" method) to assess their understanding. Questions included, "What will you be doing if you take part?" and "What can you do if you start the study but don’t want to finish it?".

- **Ongoing Consent:** Consent was treated not as a one-time event but as an ongoing process. Participants were reminded at the start of each session that they could stop at any time without any negative consequences. This is crucial to distinguish true consent from acquiescence bias or a desire to please an authority figure.

- **Surrogate Consent:** In cases where an individual's capacity to consent was clearly impaired, consent was obtained from a legally authorized representative (LAR), while still seeking the individual's assent (agreement) to participate to the greatest extent possible.

#### 10.2. Stigma Avoidance and Person-First Language

Language shapes perception. This report adheres strictly to person-first language (e.g., "an adult with an intellectual disability") rather than identity-first language ("a disabled person") or outdated, offensive labels ("retarded," "mentally handicapped"). This choice emphasizes the personhood of the individual rather than defining them by their disability. While some disability communities have reclaimed identity-first language, person-first language remains the most widely accepted standard in professional and academic contexts for intellectual disability to avoid historical stigma and dehumanization. The focus is always on abilities and experiences, not on limitations or deficits.

#### 10.3. Confidentiality and Dignity in Reporting

Protecting the privacy and dignity of our participants was paramount. All identifying information was removed from transcripts and data files. The qualitative findings presented in this report, including the vignettes and comparative timeline, are based on composite narratives. These narratives synthesize the experiences of multiple participants to illustrate common themes and patterns, ensuring that no single individual's story is identifiable while preserving the authentic truth of their collective experience. This approach honors the trust placed in the research team and protects participants from potential harm or stigma.

#### 10.4. The Researcher's Responsibility

Finally, this research was conducted with an awareness of the inherent power dynamics at play. The researcher is in a position of authority, and participants may feel obligated to cooperate. It is the researcher's ethical duty to actively mitigate this imbalance by creating a safe, non-coercive environment, ensuring participation is truly voluntary, and acting as a responsible steward of the stories shared. The ultimate goal of this work is not merely to observe and analyze, but to use the knowledge gained to advocate for greater understanding, better support systems, and a more inclusive society for a population that has too often been left in the margins.
