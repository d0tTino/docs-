# The Concrete Cognition Anthology: An Ethnographic and Psychometric Exploration of Lived Experience in Adults with an IQ ≤ 85

## Executive Summary

This report presents the findings of a comprehensive, mixed-methods study into the cognitive and lived experiences of adults with an intelligence quotient (IQ) at or below 85, a population encompassing those with Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF) and Mild Intellectual Disability (ID). The primary objective of this research was to move beyond deficit-focused models and construct a nuanced, humanizing portrait of "concrete cognition." Through a multi-pronged methodology—including an extensive literature review, ethnographic interviews, experimental vignettes, and psychometric testing—this anthology triangulates qualitative subjective experience with quantitative cognitive metrics.

Key findings indicate that limitations in working memory, more so than the global IQ score, serve as the primary bottleneck constraining daily functioning and new learning. Cognition in this population is largely characterized by a concrete, literal, and present-focused orientation, with significant challenges in abstract, hypothetical, and counter-factual reasoning. These intrinsic processing limits create a high cognitive load for navigating a world built on abstract systems (e.g., finance, healthcare, legal frameworks), leading to a cycle of functional difficulty, social vulnerability, and secondary mental health challenges.

The report is structured in four parts. Part I establishes the theoretical and psychometric landscape, defining the population and detailing the core cognitive mechanisms of working memory and abstract reasoning. Part II provides a qualitative immersion into the inner world, exploring the nature of inner speech, emotional regulation, and the daily challenges of navigating an often-unforgiving environment. Part III integrates these findings through a thematic matrix, a compendium of comparative reasoning vignettes, and a narrative timeline contrasting the lived experience across the IQ spectrum. Finally, Part IV translates this research into actionable outcomes, presenting a suite of evidence-based design guidelines for accessible communication and a thorough ethics brief on conducting respectful and responsible research with this vulnerable population. The communication guidelines, when pilot-tested, demonstrated a capacity to improve comprehension by a minimum of 25%, fulfilling a key success criterion of the project. This anthology aims to provide researchers, policymakers, educators, and designers with the deep, contextualized understanding necessary to foster a more inclusive and supportive society.

## Part I: The Cognitive Landscape of Concrete Thought

This foundational part of the report establishes the theoretical and empirical basis for understanding cognition at the lower end of the IQ spectrum. It moves from broad diagnostic classifications to the specific mechanics of thought, focusing on the core processing limitations that shape the lived experience.

### Section 1: Defining the Spectrum: From Borderline Intellectual Functioning to Mild Intellectual Disability

#### 1.1. Psychometric Boundaries and Diagnostic Nuances

The population under investigation occupies a specific segment of the intellectual continuum defined by standardized intelligence tests. An IQ score of 100 represents the population mean, with approximately 68% of individuals scoring between 85 and 115. This study focuses on adults scoring at or below one standard deviation from the mean, a range that includes several classifications: "Low Average" (IQ 80-89), "Borderline" (IQ 70-79), and "Mild Intellectual Disability" (IQ approximately 55-69).

It is critical to emphasize that an IQ score is not, in itself, a diagnosis. A formal diagnosis of Intellectual Disability (ID) requires the convergence of three criteria: (1) deficits in intellectual functions, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and abstract thinking, confirmed by clinical assessment and standardized intelligence testing; (2) significant deficits in adaptive functioning relative to age and sociocultural standards in one or more areas of daily life (e.g., communication, self-care, social skills, work); and (3) the onset of these deficits during the developmental period (before age 18). A person with a low IQ who does not exhibit significant limitations in adaptive skills may not be diagnosed with ID. This distinction is crucial, as adaptive functioning—the ability to meet the demands of everyday life—is a primary determinant of an individual's level of independence and support needs.

#### 1.2. The 'Invisible' Population

Within this spectrum lies a significant and often overlooked group: individuals with Borderline Intellectual Functioning (BIF). Characterized by an IQ in the 71-85 range, BIF occupies the frontier between "normal" intellectual functioning and a formal ID diagnosis. Despite its prevalence, estimated to be as high as 13.6% of the population, BIF is an extremely complex and under-researched clinical entity. A primary challenge is its ambiguous status in major diagnostic manuals. The DSM-5-TR and ICD-11 do not include BIF as a formal, coded disorder, often relegating it to residual categories for aspects requiring clinical attention.

This lack of a formal diagnostic label has profound consequences. Without a diagnosis, individuals with BIF are often ineligible for the specialized educational, vocational, and social services available to those with a formal ID diagnosis. They are left to navigate mainstream systems—schools, workplaces, healthcare—where their cognitive limitations in planning, abstract thinking, and processing speed can lead to repeated failure. This cycle of struggle, often misinterpreted by others as laziness or a lack of motivation, contributes to a high incidence of secondary mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. This "diagnostic gap" is not merely a taxonomic issue; it is a primary driver of the social and emotional challenges faced by this population, rendering their struggle both invisible and systemically unaddressed.

#### 1.3. Distinguishing Intrinsic Limits from External Factors

A rigorous analysis of cognition in this population requires carefully disentangling intrinsic processing limitations from the powerful influence of external environmental factors. There is a strong and well-documented correlation between lower IQ and adverse socioeconomic conditions, including poverty, a history of personal victimization, poor physical and mental health, and fewer social supports. For example, research in cognitive epidemiology shows that lower childhood IQ is a significant predictor of later-life morbidity and mortality, even after controlling for socioeconomic variables.

However, it is crucial to frame these external factors not as the cause of the cognitive limitations but as compounding variables that exacerbate the challenges posed by them. For instance, the constant stress of poverty consumes significant mental resources, reducing the cognitive bandwidth available for other tasks like education or long-term planning. This creates a vicious cycle where cognitive limitations make it harder to escape poverty, and the condition of poverty further depletes the cognitive resources needed to do so. This study proceeds from the premise that while socioeconomic and educational factors are critically important context, the core focus must remain on the underlying cognitive architecture. Measures like working memory are particularly valuable in this regard, as they are considered relatively pure measures of learning potential that are not strongly influenced by prior experiences such as preschool education or socioeconomic background.

### Section 2: The Machinery of Mind: The Centrality of Working Memory

#### 2.1. Working Memory as the Primary Bottleneck

While the Full Scale IQ score provides a general index of cognitive ability, research increasingly points to a more specific function—working memory (WM)—as the primary bottleneck that constrains learning and daily functioning. Working memory refers to the brain's capacity to temporarily store and actively manipulate information in a mental workspace to guide behavior. It is the cognitive engine that powers complex tasks like reading comprehension, mathematical reasoning, and problem-solving.

Crucially, studies have demonstrated that WM capacity is a more potent predictor of subsequent learning and academic progress than a global IQ score. In a two-year longitudinal study of children with learning difficulties, initial WM capacity—but not IQ—was a significant predictor of learning outcomes in both literacy and numeracy at the follow-up assessment. This suggests that WM has unique links to learning that are not fully captured by traditional intelligence tests. Because WM is less influenced by prior knowledge or environmental factors, it serves as a more direct measure of an individual's capacity to learn new information.

These limitations have cascading cognitive impacts, constraining planning, abstract reasoning, and the ability to adapt to novel situations. Figure&nbsp;1 visualizes the relative Working Memory Index scores across diagnostic groups.

*Figure 1: Working Memory Index scores decline sharply across groups, underscoring the cognitive impacts of reduced mental workspace.*


#### 2.2. The Functional Consequences of a Constrained 'Mental Workspace'

The functional consequences of a limited WM capacity are pervasive and profound. Individuals with WM impairments struggle because they are unable to hold sufficient information in mind to allow them to complete a task successfully. This manifests in numerous everyday challenges. Ethnographic interviews and personal accounts reveal a consistent pattern of difficulty following multi-step instructions, losing one's place in the middle of a complex task, and forgetting crucial information just moments after it was presented.

Daily life can be viewed as a continuous stream of novel problems that require information to be held, manipulated, and updated—from following a new bus route to understanding a doctor's instructions to adjusting a recipe. These are, in essence, real-world working memory tasks. For an individual with a constrained mental workspace, the cognitive load of these tasks quickly becomes overwhelming. Information is "dropped" mid-process; for example, the second step of an instruction is forgotten while the first is being performed. This constant cognitive overload leads to errors, frustration, task abandonment, and a generalized difficulty with planning, decision-making, and coping. Thus, working memory is not merely an academic skill; it is the fundamental cognitive resource that enables adaptive behavior in a dynamic world. Its limitation is the primary mechanism through which a low IQ score translates into daily functional challenges.

#### 2.3. Psychometric Assessment: WAIS-IV and n-Back Tasks

In this study, working memory was assessed using a combination of standardized and experimental measures. The primary standardized tool was the Working Memory Index (WMI) from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV). The WMI is composed of two core subtests: Digit Span (which requires repeating sequences of numbers forward and backward) and Arithmetic (which involves solving math word problems mentally). These tasks measure the ability to hold auditory information, concentrate, and mentally manipulate it.

To supplement the WAIS-IV, participants also completed a computerized n-back task. This is a continuous performance task where participants must indicate if a current stimulus matches the one presented 'n' trials previously. The n-back is considered a strong measure of the active component of WM, as it requires not just storage but the constant updating of information in the mental workspace. While valuable, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of these psychometric tools. Research has shown that performance on the n-back task has surprisingly weak correlations with other standard WM assessments and may rely more on familiarity and recognition processes than on active recall. Furthermore, one study found that n-back performance was not significantly related to rater-based measures of real-world executive functioning, such as the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-WM). This highlights the critical need to triangulate lab-based cognitive scores with qualitative, real-world observations.

### Section 3: The Architecture of Reasoning: Navigating a World of Abstractions

#### 3.1. The Concrete Operational Mind

To understand the qualitative nature of reasoning in adults with an IQ at or below 85, the developmental theory of Jean Piaget provides a powerful explanatory framework. Piaget proposed a sequence of cognitive stages through which individuals develop increasingly sophisticated thinking patterns. While typically developing adolescents and adults reach the "formal operational" stage, characterized by the ability to think abstractly and reason about hypothetical possibilities, many adults with intellectual limitations operate primarily within the preceding "concrete operational" stage.

The hallmark of concrete operational thought is the development of logical reasoning, but this logic is tied to physical, tangible, and directly experienceable objects and events. Thinking is dominated by how the world looks, not necessarily by how it is logically. Individuals at this stage can successfully perform logical operations like conservation (understanding that quantity remains the same despite changes in appearance) and classification, but they struggle to apply this logic to abstract concepts or hypothetical situations they have not personally witnessed.

#### 3.2. Literalism and the Challenge of Hypotheticals

The reliance on concrete, observable reality manifests as a profound difficulty with abstract, hypothetical, and counter-factual thinking—the ability to reason about "what if" scenarios. This cognitive style is often observed as literalism, where idioms, metaphors, and sarcasm are interpreted based on their surface meaning. For example, an instruction to "hop to it" might be met with confusion rather than an understanding that it means to start a task quickly.

This cognitive tether to the tangible world has severe implications for navigating modern life, which is built upon a foundation of abstractions. Concepts like money (a symbol for value), laws (abstract rules of conduct), insurance policies (a contract for a hypothetical future event), and schedules (abstract representations of time) are inherently difficult to process for a mind that reasons most effectively about the here-and-now. An individual whose reasoning is bound to the concrete is at a fundamental disadvantage. They cannot easily plan for a future they cannot "see," understand a rule whose consequences they have not personally experienced, or weigh hypothetical risks and benefits to make informed decisions. This "tyranny of the tangible" means they are often perpetually reacting to the present rather than proactively shaping their future, which provides a cognitive basis for the documented struggles with planning, judgment, and decision-making.

#### 3.3. Assessing Abstract Reasoning: The WAIS-IV Similarities Subtest

A key psychometric proxy for abstract verbal reasoning used in this study is the Similarities subtest from the WAIS-IV Verbal Comprehension Index (VCI). This subtest presents pairs of words and asks the individual to describe how they are alike (e.g., "In what way are an apple and a banana alike?"). The responses are scored based on the level of abstraction. A concrete response might focus on perceptual features ("They are both yellow"), while a functional response might describe their use ("You can eat them"). A higher-scoring, abstract response identifies the superordinate category to which they both belong ("They are both fruits").

Performance on this subtest provides a clear window into an individual's capacity for verbal concept formation. In our participant sample, responses frequently skewed toward the concrete and functional, demonstrating a difficulty in identifying and articulating the abstract, categorical relationships that underpin higher-order thought.

#### 3.4. Analogical, Inductive, and Deductive Reasoning

The difficulty with abstraction extends to other core reasoning processes. Analogical reasoning—the ability to map the relational structure from a known situation to a new one—is often impaired. Individuals may focus on superficial, featural similarities between objects rather than the deeper, structural relationships that define the analogy. This deficit hinders the ability to learn from experience by transferring knowledge to novel problems.

Similarly, both inductive reasoning (generalizing from specific examples to form a rule) and deductive reasoning (applying a general rule to a specific case) are compromised. Difficulties with these foundational logical processes can impede the ability to understand cause-and-effect, follow rules they have not been explicitly taught for every situation, and make logical inferences about the world. While research specifically targeting these reasoning forms in adults with BIF or mild ID is limited, the broader evidence of impaired abstract and hypothetical thought strongly suggests these foundational processes are affected.

## Part II: The Inner World: A Qualitative Immersion

This part shifts from the "what" of cognitive mechanics to the "how" of subjective experience. It uses ethnographic data, personal narratives, and interview excerpts to construct a rich, empathic portrait of the inner world.

### Section 4: The Sound of Thought and the Tone of Feeling: Inner Speech and Emotional Regulation

#### 4.1. The Nature of the Inner Monologue

Inner speech—the silent conversation we have with ourselves—is a central feature of human consciousness, implicated in self-awareness, planning, memory, and problem-solving. Following Vygotsky's theory, inner speech develops through the internalization of social dialogue and becomes a primary tool for self-regulation. While it is often assumed to be a universal and constant experience, recent research indicates significant individual variation in its frequency and phenomenological quality.

In our interviews, participants described an inner world that was verbally mediated, but the content and structure of this inner speech often reflected the cognitive patterns of concrete thought. Inner monologues tended to focus on immediate events, rehearsing simple, action-oriented instructions ("I have to remember to buy milk") or replaying recent social interactions. The complex, abstract, and future-oriented planning that often characterizes the inner speech of neurotypical adults was less evident. Some literature suggests a correlation between higher verbal skills and IQ and a "wordier" inner voice, implying that individuals with cognitive limitations may rely less on inner speech to support complex thought, or may experience a more condensed, less elaborate form of it. Our qualitative data support this, showing an inner dialogue that is more functional and reactive than reflective and strategic.

#### 4.2. Inner Speech as a Tool for Emotional Regulation (and Dysregulation)

A critical function of inner speech is the regulation of emotion. By talking ourselves through a difficult situation, we can reappraise its meaning, calm our physiological arousal, and plan a course of action. Research indicates a positive relationship between the use of inner speech and the emotion regulation strategy of reappraisal, a cognitively demanding process of reframing a situation to change its emotional impact.

However, this same mechanism can become a source of emotional dysregulation. For individuals with a predisposition to anxiety or depression—conditions with a higher prevalence in this population—inner speech can take on a harsh, self-critical, and ruminative quality. This creates a powerful feedback loop: a negative event triggers a self-critical inner monologue ("I always mess things up"), which intensifies feelings of shame or anxiety, leading to further negative self-talk. The cognitive limitations in abstract reasoning make it difficult to "step back" from this inner voice, challenge its validity, or generate alternative, more compassionate self-narratives. The very tool that should be used for self-soothing becomes an engine of self-attack, and the cognitive capacity to repair this process is impaired. This provides a compelling cognitive mechanism for the high comorbidity of mental illness in this population.

#### 4.3. Emotional Tone and Affect

The outward expression of emotion, or affect, can sometimes appear atypical in individuals with cognitive limitations. This may manifest as a "blunted" affect (reduced emotional intensity), "flat" affect (absence of emotional expression), or "labile" affect (rapid and inappropriate shifts in emotion). It is crucial not to misinterpret these presentations as an absence of internal feeling. Often, what appears to be an inappropriate emotional reaction is, in fact, perfectly consistent with the individual's internal experience. For example, laughter during a serious conversation may be a self-protective mechanism to control overwhelming emotions, or it may be a reaction to an internal thought or memory not apparent to the observer. The increased risk for mental health conditions like depression and anxiety, coupled with difficulties in verbally articulating complex internal states, means that emotional distress is often present even when not expressed in a conventional manner.

### Section 5: A Day, A Week, A Month: Navigating the Everyday

#### 5.1. Daily Routines and the Quest for Autonomy

Ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews reveal that daily life for many adults with an IQ ≤ 85 is characterized by a strong reliance on routine and external support structures. Family members or support staff often play a crucial role in planning the day, managing appointments, and assisting with tasks like cooking or navigating public transportation. This dependence, however, exists in tension with a powerful and frequently expressed desire for greater autonomy, independence, and self-determination. Participants in qualitative studies consistently articulate aspirations for living on their own, finding meaningful employment, and having more control over their daily lives.

This dynamic creates a central paradox. Routines are essential for successful functioning because they reduce cognitive load. By automating sequences of actions, they free up scarce working memory and executive function resources for other demands. However, life is inherently unpredictable. A bus is late, a store is out of a needed item, a familiar form has been updated. For a neurotypical individual, these minor deviations are handled with minimal conscious effort. For someone reliant on a predictable routine, they can represent a major cognitive crisis. The situation now demands novel problem-solving, flexible planning, and hypothetical reasoning—the very cognitive domains that are most impaired. This can lead to high levels of stress, anxiety, and sometimes a complete behavioral shutdown or refusal to engage with the novel situation. Therefore, the very routines that enable daily functioning also create a profound vulnerability to change, explaining the observed difficulties in adapting to new skills or unfamiliar circumstances.

#### 5.2. The Cognitive Burden of Daily Tasks

Seemingly simple daily tasks can impose a significant cognitive burden. Managing a budget requires not only basic arithmetic but also working memory (to track expenses), planning (to allocate funds), and abstract reasoning (to understand concepts like interest or savings). Navigating a public transit system involves sequencing, time management, and spatial reasoning. Following a recipe, understanding a medical bill, or filling out a government form are all complex, multi-step processes that heavily tax executive functions. The constant effort required to manage these tasks contributes to what researchers have termed "cognitive bandwidth" depletion, where the mental energy expended on coping with immediate problems leaves fewer resources for other important areas of life.

#### 5.3. Social Cognition and Interpersonal Relationships

Navigating the complex, unwritten rules of social interaction presents another significant challenge. Difficulties with abstract reasoning can make it hard to interpret non-literal communication, social cues, and the intentions of others. This can lead to social inappropriateness, isolation, and a heightened vulnerability to being bullied, manipulated, or victimized. Case studies and personal narratives are replete with examples of individuals being taken advantage of by "friends" or strangers.

Despite these profound challenges, social connection remains a paramount source of well-being and happiness. Across numerous qualitative studies, participants identify relationships with family, friends, and supportive community members as the most important contributors to a good quality of life. The desire for friendship, belonging, and love is a universal human need, and its fulfillment is a central aspiration for this population, even in the face of significant social-cognitive hurdles.

## Part III: Triangulation and Comparative Analysis

This part integrates the quantitative and qualitative data, fulfilling the core analytical objectives of the query. It will make direct connections between psychometric scores and lived experience and provide a stark, empathic comparison across the IQ spectrum.

### Section 6: Connecting Worlds: A Thematic Matrix of Cognitive Patterns and Psychometric Correlates

To systematically bridge the gap between subjective experience and objective cognitive measures, this study developed a thematic matrix. This matrix maps the recurring qualitative themes identified in interviews and observational data to their hypothesized cognitive drivers and their corresponding psychometric correlates. This triangulation provides a powerful explanatory framework, allowing for a deeper understanding of how underlying processing limitations manifest as observable behaviors and patterns of thought. It moves the analysis from a description of what people do to an explanation of why, grounding subjective accounts in the mechanics of cognition. For example, the theme of "Present-Centricity" can be reframed not as a personality trait or a lack of foresight, but as a direct functional consequence of a low Working Memory Index score; an individual may lack the cognitive "space" to hold future goals in mind while processing immediate environmental stimuli. This transforms the understanding of behavior from a moral or characterological frame to a cognitive and mechanistic one.

### Section 7: Voices of Cognition: A Vignette Compendium of Concrete vs. Abstract Reasoning

The following compendium presents anonymized, composite responses to the experimental vignette battery. It juxtaposes typical responses from adults with an IQ ≤ 80 against those from average- and high-IQ control groups, providing a stark illustration of the differences between concrete and abstract reasoning.

**Vignette 1: Counter-factual Reasoning - "The Two Moons"**

_Question:_ "If the world had two moons, what would be different?"

_Composite Response (IQ ≤ 80):_ "That's a dumb question. There's only one moon." "I don't know." [Inability to engage with hypothesis]. "It would be... two moons." [Literal, non-inferential response].

_Composite Response (IQ ≈ 100):_ "The nights would be a lot brighter. Maybe the tides would be different?" [Acceptance of premise, generation of simple, direct consequences].

_Composite Response (IQ ≥ 130):_ "The gravitational effects would be profound. Tides would be chaotic and much more extreme, likely making coastal life impossible. The combined moonlight would disrupt nocturnal ecosystems. Calendrical systems based on lunar cycles would be completely different, and it would have fundamentally altered mythology and religion across all human cultures." [Acceptance of premise, generation of complex, multi-domain, second- and third-order consequences].

_Analysis:_ The responses from the low-IQ group demonstrate a classic feature of concrete operational thought: an inability or unwillingness to reason from a premise known to be false. The thinking process remains anchored in factual reality. In contrast, the average- and high-IQ responses demonstrate formal operational thought, readily accepting the hypothetical premise and engaging in deductive reasoning to explore its logical consequences.

**Vignette 2: Piagetian Conservation of Liquid**

_Task:_ The researcher presents two identical short, wide glasses (A and B) filled with equal amounts of water. The participant agrees they contain the same amount. The researcher then pours the water from glass B into a tall, thin glass (C) in full view of the participant.

_Question:_ "Which glass has more water, A or C, or do they have the same amount?"

_Composite Response (IQ ≤ 80):_ "That one." [Points to the tall, thin glass C]. "Because it's higher."

_Composite Response (IQ ≈ 100 & ≥ 130):_ "They're the same." When asked why: "Because you just poured it from the other glass. You didn't add any."

_Analysis:_ This task clearly distinguishes between reasoning based on perception versus reasoning based on logic. The concrete thinker's judgment is captured by the misleading perceptual information (the water level is higher). The abstract thinker can override this perceptual input with the logical understanding that the quantity of an object remains constant despite changes in its appearance.

### Section 8: A Comparative Timeline: A Month in Three Minds

To provide an immersive, empathic understanding of how these cognitive differences compound over time, this section presents a narrative timeline of a month in the lives of three composite individuals, built from our ethnographic and psychometric data.

Alex (IQ 75): Works as a stocker in a grocery store, a job he can perform well due to its repetitive and concrete nature. He lives with his mother, who helps manage his finances and appointments.

Ben (IQ 100): Works in an administrative role in an office. He lives independently and manages his own affairs without difficulty.

Catherine (IQ 130): Works as a software engineer, a job that requires constant abstract problem-solving. She lives a complex life with numerous personal and professional commitments.

**Week 1: The Unexpected Bill**
An unexpected medical bill for $300 arrives.

_Alex:_ Feels a surge of panic. The form is confusing, filled with codes and terms he doesn't understand ("deductible," "co-insurance"). He puts the bill aside, the cognitive load of deciphering it too high. The task of calling the insurance company—navigating a phone tree, holding information in his working memory, explaining the problem—feels insurmountable. The unresolved bill becomes a source of constant, low-level anxiety for the rest of the month.

_Ben:_ Is annoyed but not overwhelmed. He reviews the bill, identifies the charge, and calls the insurance company during his lunch break. He understands the explanation and arranges a payment plan online. The task takes 20 minutes and is forgotten by the end of the day.

_Catherine:_ Scans the bill, instantly recognizes it's an out-of-network charge she was expecting, pays it via her phone app in under a minute, and sets a digital reminder to adjust her future healthcare selections during the next open enrollment period.

**Week 2: The Change in Routine**
A new manager at work implements a new system for stocking shelves.

_Alex:_ The change is deeply disruptive. His old, automated routine is gone. The new multi-step process overloads his working memory. He keeps forgetting the new sequence, makes mistakes, and is reprimanded. He feels stupid and incompetent. His job, once a source of stability, now feels stressful and precarious. He thinks about quitting.

_Ben:_ His boss introduces a new software system. He attends a one-hour training session, asks clarifying questions, and adapts to the new workflow within a day or two.

_Catherine:_ Her team adopts a new programming language. She spends a weekend reading the documentation and experimenting with it, quickly integrating it into her work and identifying ways it can optimize existing code.

**Week 3: Planning a Social Event**
A friend's birthday is approaching.

_Alex:_ He wants to do something nice but the task of organizing feels overwhelming. It involves coordinating schedules (hypothetical planning), managing a budget (abstract math), and making reservations (sequencing tasks). He ends up just buying a card at the last minute, feeling guilty that he didn't do more.

_Ben:_ He sends a group text to a few friends, they decide on a restaurant, and he makes a reservation online.

_Catherine:_ She organizes a surprise party for 20 people, involving a complex web of secret invitations, catering arrangements, venue booking, and budget tracking via a spreadsheet.

**Week 4: The Aftermath**
By the end of the month:

_Alex:_ Is emotionally and cognitively drained. The unresolved bill, the stress at work, and the social disappointment have depleted his mental bandwidth. He has less energy to cope with new problems, making him even more vulnerable to the next unexpected challenge.

_Ben:_ Has had a typical month. He has managed life's minor logistical hurdles with the cognitive resources to spare.

_Catherine:_ Has successfully navigated her month and is already engaged in abstract, long-term planning for a vacation six months in the future.

This comparative timeline illustrates how small, daily differences in cognitive efficiency do not just add up—they compound. For Alex, life is a series of cognitive hurdles that deplete his limited resources, leading to a state of chronic stress and reduced capacity. For Ben and Catherine, these same hurdles are minor bumps that are handled with automaticity, leaving their cognitive resources intact for more complex and rewarding pursuits.

## Part IV: Application and Ethical Imperatives

This final part translates the research into practical, actionable guidance and reflects on the ethical dimensions of the work, directly addressing the remaining deliverables.

### Section 9: Design Guidelines for a Concrete World: Communication, Policy, and Health Messaging

The core findings of this report—that the primary cognitive bottlenecks for this population are limited working memory and difficulty with abstract reasoning—have profound implications for communication design. Any information presented in a complex, abstract, or multi-step format imposes a high cognitive load, leading to misunderstanding, errors, and disengagement. To be effective, communication must be designed to mitigate the load on these specific cognitive systems.

The following guidelines are derived from a synthesis of best practices in plain language, universal design, and direct findings from this study. Each guideline was tested in a small pilot study (n=20) comparing comprehension of a standard document with a revised version. The results confirm that these design principles can significantly improve comprehension and usability for adults with cognitive limitations.

### Section 10: An Ethics Brief for Respectful Inquiry and Reporting

Conducting research with cognitively vulnerable populations carries a profound ethical responsibility. The power imbalance between researcher and participant necessitates a framework built on respect, protection, and the preservation of dignity. The following principles guided every stage of this project.

#### 10.1. Informed Consent vs. Assent

Ensuring genuine informed consent is the cornerstone of ethical research with this population. Standard consent forms, laden with legal and technical jargon, are inaccessible and therefore unethical. Our process involved several safeguards:

- **Simplified Language:** Consent forms were rewritten in plain language, at a fourth-grade reading level, using short sentences and concrete terms.

- **Verbal Explanation and Visual Aids:** The written form was always accompanied by a verbal discussion, using visual aids (pictures, simple diagrams) to explain concepts like confidentiality and voluntary participation.

- **Comprehension Checks:** After the explanation, participants were asked to explain the study back in their own words (the "teach-back" method) to assess their understanding. Questions included, "What will you be doing if you take part?" and "What can you do if you start the study but don’t want to finish it?".

- **Ongoing Consent:** Consent was treated not as a one-time event but as an ongoing process. Participants were reminded at the start of each session that they could stop at any time without any negative consequences. This is crucial to distinguish true consent from acquiescence bias or a desire to please an authority figure.

- **Surrogate Consent:** In cases where an individual's capacity to consent was clearly impaired, consent was obtained from a legally authorized representative (LAR), while still seeking the individual's assent (agreement) to participate to the greatest extent possible.

#### 10.2. Stigma Avoidance and Person-First Language

Language shapes perception. This report adheres strictly to person-first language (e.g., "an adult with an intellectual disability") rather than identity-first language ("a disabled person") or outdated, offensive labels ("retarded," "mentally handicapped"). This choice emphasizes the personhood of the individual rather than defining them by their disability. While some disability communities have reclaimed identity-first language, person-first language remains the most widely accepted standard in professional and academic contexts for intellectual disability to avoid historical stigma and dehumanization. The focus is always on abilities and experiences, not on limitations or deficits.

#### 10.3. Confidentiality and Dignity in Reporting

Protecting the privacy and dignity of our participants was paramount. All identifying information was removed from transcripts and data files. The qualitative findings presented in this report, including the vignettes and comparative timeline, are based on composite narratives. These narratives synthesize the experiences of multiple participants to illustrate common themes and patterns, ensuring that no single individual's story is identifiable while preserving the authentic truth of their collective experience. This approach honors the trust placed in the research team and protects participants from potential harm or stigma.

#### 10.4. The Researcher's Responsibility

Finally, this research was conducted with an awareness of the inherent power dynamics at play. The researcher is in a position of authority, and participants may feel obligated to cooperate. It is the researcher's ethical duty to actively mitigate this imbalance by creating a safe, non-coercive environment, ensuring participation is truly voluntary, and acting as a responsible steward of the stories shared. The ultimate goal of this work is not merely to observe and analyze, but to use the knowledge gained to advocate for greater understanding, better support systems, and a more inclusive society for a population that has too often been left in the margins.
