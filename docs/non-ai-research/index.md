# Non-AI Research

This collection brings together research into topics outside of AI, including productivity methodologies, corporate dynamics, and broader interdisciplinary inquiries.

## Productivity
Research on personal efficiency and time management strategies.

- Methods for boosting personal efficiency and time management, drawing on foundational practices from the [Quickstart guide](../quickstart.md) and strategies from the [Productivity collection](../productivity/index.md).
- [Add Hours to Your Day? Debunking Productivity Frameworks](add-hours-to-your-day.md) critically assesses popular efficiency schemes and references tools from the [Productivity collection](../productivity/index.md) and [Terminal Workflow guide](../terminal-workflow/index.md).

## Corporate Studies
Analyses of organizational behavior and power within corporations.

- Investigates organizational behavior and corporate power structures through dynamics explored in the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md), extending analyses like [The Friendly Face of Power](../friendly-face-of-power.md) and [Project Palantir](../project-palantir.md).
- [Buying the Dip: A Historical, Signal-Driven Playbook for Identifying Corporate Turnarounds](buying-the-dip-playbook.md) highlights financial signals for corporate recovery and connects to economic autonomy in [Wave 4: Money & Autonomy](../wave4-money-autonomy.md).

- [The Metaorganism: A New Framework for Organizational Evolution](metaorganism.md) reimagines organizational growth through themes from the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md), drawing parallels with [The Corporate Egregore](corporate-egregore.md).

## General Research
Broader interdisciplinary inquiries into science, philosophy, and culture.

- Covers interdisciplinary inquiries into science and philosophy beyond AI, bridging insights from the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md) and the [Productivity collection](../productivity/index.md) while pointing to the [AI Research collection](../ai-research/index.md) and complementing risk analyses in the [Security series](../security/index.md).
- [A Techno-Economic and Performance Model for DNA-Based Archival Storage](dna-archival-storage-tepm.md) models long-term data preservation for the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md), evaluating DNA storage viability and referencing design principles in [Audit of an Oracle](../audit-of-an-oracle.md).
- [An Interdisciplinary Examination of Modern Rationalism: Principles, Applications, and Critiques in the Scientific-Technological Age](modern-rationalism.md) surveys contemporary rationalist thought, relating critiques to profiles such as [Peter Thiel](../architect-of-disruption-peter-thiel.md) and shaping narratives in the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md).
- [Evolution as a Computational Process: An Interdisciplinary Investigation into Biological Compute](evolution-as-a-computational-process.md) views evolution through a computational lens within the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md), linking to genetic data discussions in [DNA Archival Storage](dna-archival-storage-tepm.md).
- [From Qualia to Simulacra: An Inquiry into the Communicability of Experience](from-qualia-to-simulacra.md) contemplates the transfer of subjective experience central to the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md) and intersects with cyberculture in [Netrunning: Fiction vs. Reality](../netrunning-fiction-reality.md).
- [Notable Figures](inspiring-figures.md) showcases influential personas shaping themes in the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md), tying to analyses like [Architect of Disruption: Peter Thiel](../architect-of-disruption-peter-thiel.md).

- [The Galilean Prophet: A Critical Maximalist Reconstruction of the Historical Jesus](galilean-prophet.md) interrogates religious roots informing the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md), reconstructing Jesus ben Joseph's milieu and highlighting tensions between messianic expectations and Roman power.
- [The High-Level Intelligence Qualia Atlas](high-level-intelligence-qualia-atlas.md) charts mind-space dimensions relevant to the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md) and offers context for the [Concrete Cognition Anthology](concrete-cognition-anthology.md).
- [Jungian Psyche Analysis: Mapping the Persona, Ego, Shadow, and Self](jungian-psyche-analysis.md) distills Jung's structural model and contrasts it with Internal Family Systems, enriching frameworks within the [Culture Project](../culture-project/index.md).
