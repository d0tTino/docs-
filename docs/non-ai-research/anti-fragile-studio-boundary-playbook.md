# Anti-Fragile Studio Boundary Playbook

Scripts are social scaffolding. They convert expectations from personal
pleas into procedural guardrails so you can preserve focus, emotional
bandwidth, and decision quality. Use this playbook whenever executive
resources dip—copy the relevant script, personalise placeholders, and
send it without second-guessing.

## How to Use This Playbook

1. Tag scripts inside your knowledge base (Notion, Obsidian, Google
   Docs) so you can search by scenario keywords.
2. Highlight placeholders—`[project]`, `[date]`, `[invoice number]`,
   `[clause]`—before saving to keep edits quick.
3. Pair each script with a one-breath regulation cue ("Pause. Breathe.
   Open the playbook.") so you remember to consult it before replying.

## Budget Alignment

**Budget mismatch (decline)**

> Thank you so much for reaching out and for your interest in my work.
> Based on the scope you’ve described, this project falls outside my
> current budget range. I wish you the best of luck finding the right
> artist.

## Timeline Guardrails

**Initial timeline conflict**

> Thank you for this detailed inquiry. I’m currently booked and wouldn’t
> be able to give this project the focused attention it deserves within
> your timeframe. My next availability for a project of this scale begins
> on [date].

**Deadline check-in**

> I’m checking in on the feedback for [deliverable], which was due on
> [date]. Our timeline depends on receiving notes by the agreed dates. A
> feedback delay will shift the final delivery accordingly. Let me know
> when to expect your notes so I can update the schedule.

## Scope Control

**Scope change request**

> That’s an interesting idea. It falls outside the scope defined in our
> signed agreement. I’m happy to scope it as a new phase once we complete
> our current goals. Shall I prepare a separate proposal for that work?

## Feedback & Issue Resolution

**Vague dissatisfaction**

> Thank you for the feedback. To make sure I address everything
> accurately, could you complete our Structured Feedback Form? It walks
> through what’s working, what needs adjustment, and your suggested next
> steps so I can respond precisely.

**Invoice questions**

> I appreciate you raising this. The signed proposal outlines the fee in
> section [clause]. Take a look and let me know if there’s a specific
> detail you’d like to revisit—I’m happy to clarify how it applies to
> this phase.

## Communication Channels

**Channel consolidation**

> To keep production time protected, I manage all project communication
> inside our shared email thread. Chat apps and DMs tend to get lost. If
> you need to reach me urgently, please mark the email as high priority
> and I’ll respond during my next communication window.

**Office hours & response times**

> My response window for client communication is Monday–Thursday,
> 10:00–16:00 local time. If I receive your message outside these hours,
> I’ll respond during the next window. This keeps production time focused
> so your project moves faster.

## Payment Enforcement

**Deposit gate**

> The next milestone begins once the 50% deposit is received. I’ve
> attached the invoice with payment links for card, bank transfer, or
> Wise. As soon as the payment arrives, I’ll confirm the production start
> date.

**Late payment follow-up**

> Friendly reminder that invoice #[number] for [project phase] is now
> [X] days past due. As outlined in section [clause] of our agreement, a
> late fee of [percentage] will apply after [date]. Please let me know if
> the payment is already in transit or if you need the invoice resent.

## Workflow Maintenance

- Store a one-page index of these scripts with scenario tags such as
  `budget`, `timeline`, `scope`, `payment`, and `communication`.
- Archive resolved conversations alongside the script you used to build
  evidence for future boundary enforcement.
- Revisit scripts quarterly to refine tone, add common edge cases, and
  update contractual references.
