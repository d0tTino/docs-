# Artist Attention Scorecard Template

Use this printable sheet to record the leading indicators described in the field guide without needing to reformat the table every session. Print the table directly from MkDocs or copy it into the note-taking app of your choice for digital tracking.

## How to Use

1. Start a new session by writing the date in the first column and logging each metric as you go.
2. Treat the "Why it matters" notes as a quick prompt to stay focused on sustainability rather than perfectionism.
3. Duplicate the table into a spreadsheet if you prefer running totals; saving a copy as `.xlsx` keeps the running history while this Markdown file stays clean.

| Session Date | Estimated Flow Minutes | Micro-Goals Hit | Boundary Breaks Taken | Recovery Action Done? (Y/N) | Next Session's First Goal Written? (Y/N) | Notes |

## Metric Reference

| Metric | Tracking Prompt | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Estimated Flow Minutes | Log the total number of minutes that felt like voluntary, sustainable focus. | Tracks sustainable focus minutes rather than raw hours. |
| Micro-Goals Hit | Count how many 15â€“25 minute micro-goals you completed. | Measures session structure and follow-through. |
| Boundary Breaks Taken | Note how many deliberate breaks protected your attention tunnel. | Rewards the breaks that prevent burnout. |
| Recovery Action Done? | Mark `Y` or `N` after completing a recovery ritual before ending the session. | Confirms that recovery is treated as part of the job. |
| Next Session's First Goal Written? | Record whether you wrote the first action for the next session. | Lowers initiation friction for the next work block. |
