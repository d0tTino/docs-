# Attention Checkpoint Card

Use this one-page card to stay in the flow lane, monitor hyperfocus flags, and deploy the Exit Ramp before energy crashes. Print it on cardstock, laminate it, and keep a dry-erase marker nearby.

## Flow vs. Hyperfocus Checkpoints

| ☐ | Flow Signal | Hyperfocus Flag | Quick Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ☐ | **Goal Clarity**<br><span style="font-size:1.1em;">I can say the next 15-minute goal aloud.</span> | I hesitate, ramble, or draw a blank. | Pause, define the goal in one sentence, and write it down. |
| ☐ | **Challenge ↔ Skill Fit**<br><span style="font-size:1.1em;">Task feels engagingly difficult but doable.</span> | Task feels dull *or* panic-inducing. | Raise or lower difficulty by ~10% to return to the flow channel. |
| ☐ | **Sense of Control**<br><span style="font-size:1.1em;">I can pause voluntarily without dread.</span> | Attention feels sticky or compulsive. | Take one deep breath, reset timer, prep Exit Ramp. |
| ☐ | **Body Awareness**<br><span style="font-size:1.1em;">I notice hunger, thirst, pain, and time cues.</span> | I've ignored bodily signals for 60 minutes. | Launch the Exit Ramp protocol immediately. |

## Exit Ramp Protocol

| ☐ | Step | What to Do | Why It Protects Energy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ☐ | **Hard Stop Cue** | Trigger a loud alarm, save work, capture a screenshot, and write “Next, I will…” with the very next step. | Externalizes working memory and interrupts the hyperfocus loop. |
| ☐ | **Physical Reset** | Stand, stretch, hydrate, and take three deep breaths away from the desk (60–120 seconds). | Reconnects interoceptive signals and resets posture. |
| ☐ | **Conscious Decision** | Choose: resume with a 20–25 minute timer, switch to a 15-minute bridge task, or log out for full recovery. | Puts attention back under voluntary control and protects reserves. |

**Reminder:** Run the checkpoint timer every 45–60 minutes. If two hyperfocus flags appear back-to-back, schedule a longer recovery block before resuming deep work.
