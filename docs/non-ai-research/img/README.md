# Painterly Brush Effect Image Checklist

The **painterly-style-clip-studio-paint.md** guide references PNG assets that live beside this
README. To keep the repository lightweight and binary-free, those images are _not_ stored in git.
When you're ready to supply your own examples, export them as PNG files and place them in this
folder using the exact filenames below so the existing Markdown links resolve automatically. Add
those filenames (and any alternate exports such as JPEGs) to your `.gitignore` so local renders
stay out of the repository. For example:

```
# Painterly brush demo captures
docs/non-ai-research/img/*.png
docs/non-ai-research/img/*.jpg
docs/non-ai-research/img/*.jpeg
```

- Recommended canvas: 1600×900 px (or similar 16:9 ratio) with transparent or neutral-gray
  background.
- Suggested export: PNG, 72–150 DPI, avoid color profiles that clip when uploaded to the web.
- Keep file sizes modest (<1 MB) so the documentation site loads quickly.
- Provide descriptive alt text for each uploaded image to keep the docs accessible (for example,
  "Alt text: Painterly brush strokes transitioning from deep indigo to pale lavender with visible
  bristle texture across a neutral gray background.").

| File name | Depicts | Capture tips |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `oil-paint-flat-blend.png` | Oil Paint Flat brush blending mid-tones | Show a blend from dark to light at ~90% opacity with visible bristle edges. |
| `cats-tongue-taper.png` | Cat's Tongue brush taper | Draw several pressure-varied strokes that flare and taper like a filbert brush. |
| `ink-tapered-raw-texture.png` | Ink Tapered Raw brush texture | Highlight the dry, grainy tail of the stroke against a mid-value background. |
| `flat-ribbon-blocks.png` | Flat Ribbon palette knife block-in | Demonstrate chunky, angular strokes carving light and shadow shapes. |
| `flat-ribbon-soft-random.png` | Flat Ribbon Soft texture randomness | Stamp strokes showing different terminal textures generated per dab. |
| `hoarse-oil-pressure.png` | Hoarse Oil pressure response | Paint a strip transitioning from light pressure blends to firm, opaque marks. |
| `su-cream-pencil-sketch.png` | SU-Cream Pencil sketch grain | Capture clean vs. rough pencil marks outlining a simple form. |
| `thick-paints-impasto.png` | Thick Paints impasto effect | Stack overlapping, high-impasto strokes with subtle hue shifts. |
| `textured-thick-lineart-grit.png` | Textured Thick Lineart grit | Show linework with toothy edges over a flat mid-tone fill. |
| `post-process-blend.png` | Post-process Blend tool result | Compare untouched vs. smudged edges using the Blend sub tool. |
| `active-color-mix.png` | Active color mixing swatches | Display wet-on-wet strokes where hues merge with visible texture. |
| `hard-edge-demo.png` | Hard edge example | Present two solid shapes with a crisp dividing line. |
| `soft-edge-demo.png` | Soft edge gradient | Fade between two values with an airbrush-style gradient. |
| `textured-edge-demo.png` | Textured lost edge | Illustrate a broken, textured transition where form dissolves into background. |
