# Composition 101 — Chaptered Intro (with Links)

This primer distills essential composition frameworks into a chaptered guide. Each
section pairs quick-reading explanations with original sources so you can dig
further into museum definitions, UX research on visual hierarchy, and
cinematography tips without getting lost in theory.

## Chapter 1 — What “composition” actually means

Composition is the deliberate arrangement of visual elements so an image reads
clearly and feels intentional. Museums and art organizations describe its core as
balance, unity, proportion, emphasis, and rhythm—the scaffolding that makes
pictures “work.”

### Why it matters

A strong composition gives the viewer a path—what to look at first, second, and
third—and prevents accidental clutter from fighting your focal point. That path is
your visual hierarchy, the intentional ordering of attention magnets across the
frame.

## Chapter 2 — The Rule of Thirds (ROT): the starter grid

Imagine a tic-tac-toe grid over your frame; place key elements along those lines or
at the four intersections (“power points”). It’s popular because it’s fast, readable,
and avoids dead-center stagnation.

### How to use (quick recipes)

- **Horizon:** Drop it on the top or bottom third, not dead center, to avoid a static
  split.
- **People:** Align eyes near the top third and leave lead room in the direction the
  subject faces so the shot breathes.
- **Single subject:** Park the main feature on a power point and let supporting shapes
  ride a grid line to reinforce your focus.

### Where it came from

The phrase “rule of thirds” dates to 1797 (John Thomas Smith), but the modern
grid-and-intersection teaching is a later simplification. Don’t confuse it with the
Golden Ratio—they are distinct frameworks.

## Chapter 3 — Visual weight & hierarchy (why thirds “feel” good)

Your eye is pulled by contrast, brightness, color saturation, sharp detail, size, and
placement. Use those levers to make your focal point the heaviest “thing,” then
taper weight as the eye travels.

### Mini-checklist while composing

- Is the focal point the highest contrast spot?
- Do size, detail, or saturation boosts reinforce the subject?
- Does placement on the thirds grid support the weight pattern you designed?

## Chapter 4 — Space, headroom, and lead room (especially for figures & film)

- **Headroom:** The space above a subject’s head to the top of frame. Too much makes
  people look like they’re sinking; too little feels cramped. Eyes near the upper
  third usually nail it.
- **Lead/Nose/Look room:** Leave more space in front of where the subject looks or
  moves. Place the face along a vertical third and leave room on the side they face.
  ROT makes this simple.

## Chapter 5 — Balance & negative space (calm vs. tension)

- **Symmetrical balance** (often centered) feels formal and calm.
- **Asymmetrical balance** uses unequal visual weights to stay lively but stable.
- **Negative space** isn’t empty—it shapes the subject, sets pacing, and can even
  become the point. Use it deliberately.

## Chapter 6 — Beyond Thirds: Phi, spirals, and dynamic symmetry (optional tools)

- **Golden Ratio / Phi grid / spiral:** Guides that push focal points slightly closer to
  center. Some artists prefer the “natural” sweep—test both grids and pick what fits
  the story.
- **Dynamic symmetry / armatures:** Root rectangles and diagonal armatures give you
  richer scaffolds for complex scenes once you’re comfortable with thirds.

## Chapter 7 — Value first: Notan & tonal design (the secret sauce)

Strong compositions usually “read” in two or three big value masses (light group vs.
dark group). Quick Notan (black/white) or 3-value studies help you spot winning
arrangements fast.

## Chapter 8 — When to break the rule (on purpose)

- Center the subject for power, symmetry, or an uncanny graphic feel.
- Crush the horizon (all sky or all ground) to exaggerate mood.
- Smother with negative space for isolation or stylized minimalism.

Even rule-of-thirds advocates stress it’s guidance, not law—use it until you can
explain why you’re breaking it.

## Chapter 9 — 15-minute practice loop (do these today)

- **A/B/C crops:** Center vs. left third vs. right third. Note how the mood shifts.
- **Horizon study:** Shoot the same scene with the horizon on top vs. bottom third.
  Pick the better story.
- **Lead-room flip:** Portrait facing left; place on right third (comfortable) vs. left
  third (crowded). Feel the difference.
- **2-value Notan:** Reduce a WIP to black/white shapes and adjust until the focal
  path is unmistakable.

## Chapter 10 — Set up helpful guides in your apps

- **Clip Studio Paint:** Use the Straight Ruler with “Equal Division = 3,” or divide a
  frame folder 3×3 for a reusable overlay.
- **Procreate:** Actions → Canvas → Drawing Guide → Edit → 2D Grid. Enter exact pixel
  values so gridlines fall on thirds (the guide defaults to squares).
