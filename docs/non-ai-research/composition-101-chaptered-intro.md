# Composition 101 — Chaptered Intro (with Links)

This primer distills essential composition frameworks into a chaptered guide. Each
section pairs quick-reading explanations with original sources so you can dig
further into museum definitions, UX research on visual hierarchy, and
cinematography tips without getting lost in theory.

## Chapter 1 — What “composition” actually means

Composition is the deliberate arrangement of visual elements so an image reads
clearly and feels intentional. Museums and art organizations describe its core as
balance, unity, proportion, emphasis, and rhythm—the scaffolding that makes
pictures “work.”

### Why it matters

A strong composition gives the viewer a path—what to look at first, second, and
third—and prevents accidental clutter from fighting your focal point. That path is
your visual hierarchy, the intentional ordering of attention magnets across the
frame.

## Chapter 2 — The Rule of Thirds (ROT): the starter grid

Imagine a tic-tac-toe grid over your frame; place key elements along those lines or
at the four intersections (“power points”). It’s popular because it’s fast, readable,
and avoids dead-center stagnation.

### How to use (quick recipes)

- **Horizon:** Drop it on the top or bottom third, not dead center, to avoid a static
  split.
- **People:** Align eyes near the top third and leave lead room in the direction the
  subject faces so the shot breathes.
- **Single subject:** Park the main feature on a power point and let supporting shapes
  ride a grid line to reinforce your focus.

### Where it came from

The phrase “rule of thirds” dates to 1797 (John Thomas Smith), but the modern
grid-and-intersection teaching is a later simplification. Don’t confuse it with the
Golden Ratio—they are distinct frameworks.

- [Wikipedia — Rule of Thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds)

## Chapter 3 — Visual weight & hierarchy (why thirds “feel” good)

Your eye is pulled by contrast, brightness, color saturation, sharp detail, size, and
placement. Use those levers to make your focal point the heaviest “thing,” then
taper weight as the eye travels.

### Mini-checklist while composing

- Is the focal point the highest contrast spot?
- Do size, detail, or saturation boosts reinforce the subject?
- Does placement on the thirds grid support the weight pattern you designed?

## Chapter 4 — Space, headroom, and lead room (especially for figures & film)

- **Headroom:** The space above a subject’s head to the top of frame. Too much makes
  people look like they’re sinking; too little feels cramped. Eyes near the upper
  third usually nail it.
- **Lead/Nose/Look room:** Leave more space in front of where the subject looks or
  moves. Place the face along a vertical third and leave room on the side they face.
  ROT makes this simple.

- [PremiumBeat — Shot Composition: Lead Room](https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/shot-composition-lead-room/)

## Chapter 5 — Balance & negative space (calm vs. tension)

- **Symmetrical balance** (often centered) feels formal and calm.
- **Asymmetrical balance** uses unequal visual weights to stay lively but stable.
- **Negative space** isn’t empty—it shapes the subject, sets pacing, and can even
  become the point. Use it deliberately.

- [The Arty Teacher — What Is Negative Space?](https://theartyteacher.com/what-is-negative-space/)

## Chapter 6 — Beyond Thirds: Phi, spirals, and dynamic symmetry (optional tools)

- **Golden Ratio / Phi grid / spiral:** Guides that push focal points slightly closer to
  center. Some artists prefer the “natural” sweep—test both grids and pick what fits
  the story.
- **Dynamic symmetry / armatures:** Root rectangles and diagonal armatures give you
  richer scaffolds for complex scenes once you’re comfortable with thirds.

## Chapter 7 — Value first: Notan & tonal design (the secret sauce)

Strong compositions usually “read” in two or three big value masses (light group vs.
dark group). Quick Notan (black/white) or 3-value studies help you spot winning
arrangements fast.

### Value Grouping and Notan Design

#### What Is Notan?
Notan ([濃淡](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notan), meaning “dark-light” in Japanese) is a design concept that focuses on the arrangement of light and dark shapes in an image.[^notan-wiki] In practice, a Notan study reduces a composition to just a few tonal values—usually black and white—to reveal its fundamental value structure without the distraction of color or fine detail.[^will-kemp] [^draw-paint] Midtones must be pushed into either the light or dark group, a creative choice that favors design clarity over literal accuracy.[^sedwick]

> **Tip:** Think of Notan as binary design. Instead of shading to show 3D form (that is the job of a fuller value study), you decide what belongs to the light family versus the shadow family in the simplest terms—a process that strengthens interpretation skills and resists copy-the-reference habits.[^notan-wiki] [^sedwick]

#### How Notan Differs from Grayscale Studies
A full grayscale or tonal study may use the entire value spectrum to render form realistically. Notan, by contrast, limits the palette to only two or three values. In a strict two-value Notan, every element is either pure black or pure white, forcing subtle midtones to take sides.[^notan-wiki] This limitation produces a bold, flat design whose shapes read instantly. Add too many intermediate grays and the design drifts toward a traditional tonal rendering.[^draw-paint] True Notan studies typically stay at two values (black and white) or occasionally three (black, white, and a single mid-gray); once you reach four or more values, the exercise behaves more like a full value study.[^draw-paint]

#### Notan and Positive/Negative Space
Translating an image into flat dark and light shapes heightens awareness of both positive and negative space.[^notan-wiki] By paying attention to silhouetted forms and the shapes between them, you can design compositions that remain compelling even in abstraction. Well-designed Notan often feels like a pleasing pattern on its own because it exposes the underlying harmony of light and dark masses.[^will-kemp]

#### Why Value Grouping Matters
Value grouping means clustering lights with lights and darks with darks to create larger, unified shapes instead of scattering high-contrast accents everywhere.[^gurney-grouping] Doing so yields an image that reads at a glance—even when seen from across a room or shrunk to thumbnail size—and gives you deliberate control over focus.[^gurney-grouping] [^gurney-focus]

James Gurney describes the tactic as “relegating” less important passages into light-on-light or dark-on-dark masses so that only the focal area carries the strongest contrast.[^gurney-focus] Imagine one composition with a single dominant dark shape against a dominant light shape—say, a silhouetted foreground against a bright sky—versus the same scene broken into ten competing gray patches. The grouped version is clearer, punchier, and easier to interpret.

**Key benefits of disciplined value grouping**

- **Instant clarity:** A well-grouped image still reads when reduced to a small thumbnail because the eye immediately sees the large light/dark pattern.[^gurney-grouping]
- **Visual impact:** Fewer, larger tonal shapes create graphic strength similar to logos or posters that rely on bold two-value designs.
- **Focus and mood control:** Keeping most contrasts subtle within a group and reserving the highest contrast for the focal point directs the viewer’s attention and sets the overall light-versus-dark mood.[^gurney-focus]
- **Simplified detail:** Grouping values forces you to absorb tiny highlights or shadows into broader pools, yielding a cleaner, more intentional look.

#### Common Mistakes in Value Grouping (and How to Avoid Them)
- **Too many value zones:** Using five or more unrelated value ranges weakens the design. Limit the image to two or three major groups in the planning stage, and err on merging similar shapes rather than fragmenting them.[^gurney-values]
- **Scattered or patchy contrast:** Sprinkling alternating lights and darks everywhere creates a “busy” checkerboard. Think in terms of light families and dark families, and cluster them together.[^gurney-values] Howard Pyle summarized the idea as: “Put your white against white, ... black against black, then black and white where you want the center of interest.”[^gurney-values]
- **Ignoring midtones (or using only midtones):** Some artists discard midtones entirely, while others let everything collapse into dull middle-gray. If you introduce a third value, do so purposefully—as a buffer or accent—and ensure one value group dominates the image.[^gurney-values]
- **Over-detailing the Notan:** Drawing tiny highlights and outlines defeats the exercise. Use a large brush or marker, stay zoomed out, and classify every shape strictly as light or dark.[^sedwick]

#### How to Do a Notan Pass on an Image (Step by Step)
1. **Pick a clear reference.** Start with a scene that has obvious light and shadow patterns—direct sunlight or a single strong light source makes simplification easier.[^will-kemp]
2. **Identify the extremes.** Note the darkest darks (deep shadows, black objects) and lightest lights (highlights, bright surfaces). Everything darker will join the shadow group; everything lighter will join the light group.
3. **Fill the dark masses.** Paint every shadow-area as a single flat black shape. Connect adjacent dark patches whenever possible to form a few large silhouettes rather than many isolated spots.[^will-kemp]
4. **Reserve the lights.** Leave the brightest areas white (or paint them white on toned paper) so that, with step 3, you have already established a two-value design.
5. **Assign the midtones.** Decide whether each ambiguous middle value helps the composition more as a light or as a dark and fill it accordingly. Avoid introducing new gray values at this stage.[^will-kemp]
6. **Merge and simplify edges.** Look for opportunities to combine neighboring shapes for cleaner massing. Lost edges are welcome—if two objects share the same shadow, let them merge into one unit.
7. **Refine the focal area.** Evaluate the pattern. If your subject disappears inside a mass, move it to the opposite value group or carve out contrast where you want the viewer to look, following Howard Pyle’s contrast principle.[^gurney-focus]
8. **Optionally add a third value.** After the two-value design works, you may introduce a single midtone (often a 50% gray) for secondary elements, keeping it subordinate to the main light and dark masses.[^draw-paint]
9. **Study and iterate.** Judge whether the final Notan feels balanced and interesting on its own. Iterate quickly—most Notan thumbnails take five to fifteen minutes, and exploring multiple versions reveals the strongest arrangement first.[^will-kemp]

> **Note:** Because Notan is shorthand, it is faster and cheaper to adjust a black-and-white plan now than to fix a fully rendered painting later. Many artists keep the Notan thumbnail visible while painting to guard the value structure.

#### Tools and Techniques for Digital Notan Studies
Digital apps make value-group experiments fast while still encouraging disciplined grouping.

##### Clip Studio Paint (CSP)
- **Binarization (Threshold) filter:** Edit → Tonal Correction → Binarization instantly converts an image to black and white. Adjust the slider until the shadow pattern matches what you want, then fine-tune manually.[^reddit-csp]
- **Lasso Fill or opaque pens:** Use the Lasso Fill tool or a solid G-pen/Maru brush at 100% opacity to block in shadow masses on a separate layer. Toggle the reference layer on and off to check the abstract pattern.
- **Fill-tool flatting:** Duplicate your artwork, push it toward high contrast, and drop fills into dark or light regions. Clean anti-aliased edges with the Binarization filter if needed.
- **Posterization and tone options:** Edit → Tonal Correction → Posterization (or the 3 Tone Draft setting) can reduce an image to a limited value set, though you will likely need manual cleanup afterward.
- **Negative-painting workflow:** Fill a layer with black and use the transparent color (eraser) to carve out the light shapes—similar to cutting white paper from a dark sheet.
- **Grayscale preview:** View → Color Profile → Preview in Grayscale helps you audit the overall value grouping even when you return to full-color painting.

##### Procreate (iPad)
- **Manual painting:** Add a new layer, select a solid brush (Monoline, Studio Pen), and paint the shadow masses directly over your sketch. Keep the background layer white so anything unpainted reads as light.
- **Curves/contrast adjustments:** Duplicate the reference and use Curves or Brightness/Contrast to collapse values toward black and white. This creates a rough starting point that you can refine into clean shapes.[^apple-stack]
- **Automatic selection threshold:** Tap-and-drag with the Automatic Selection tool to capture value ranges, then fill selections with black. Repeat for the light group to simulate posterization.[^apple-stack]
- **Color Drop fills:** Drag the color swatch into enclosed areas and adjust the Color Drop Threshold for broad, flat fills—useful once you’ve outlined major shapes.[^procreate-handbook]
- **Eraser-as-light workflow:** Fill the canvas with black and erase the light shapes, mimicking scratchboard while reinforcing the idea of carving light out of dark.
- **App helpers:** External tools like Notanizer or SeeValue can generate quick two- or three-value references for practice.[^will-kemp] Use them sparingly so you continue training your own eye.

> **Example workflow:** Import a photo, lower its opacity, and on a new layer paint the shadow masses in black. Hide the photo, add a white layer underneath, and judge the resulting black-and-white pattern. Duplicate the layer to explore alternative groupings or add a controlled third value.

#### Examples of Value Grouping in Art History
- **John Singer Sargent — “Two Girls Fishing” (1912):** The white dresses and reflective water join into one dominant light mass, while foliage and the seated figure’s dark outfit merge into a unified shadow, leaving the sharpest contrast near the focal profile.[^sargent]
- **James Gurney:** Gurney regularly performs quick value-massing studies to avoid accidentally using the full value range everywhere, a discipline inspired by Howard Pyle’s illustration teachings.[^gurney-substack] [^gurney-values]
- **Howard Pyle and Golden Age illustrators:** Pyle urged students to compose with a few tones first. Artists such as N.C. Wyeth and Dean Cornwell often let entire backgrounds sink into a single dark mass so lighter figures pop dramatically.[^gurney-values]
- **Baroque chiaroscuro (e.g., Rembrandt):** Spotlighted faces emerge from deep shadow, essentially giant two-value designs. In “Landscape with a Stone Bridge,” broad dark storm clouds oppose a burst of light on the bridge, showing an extreme Notan balance.
- **James McNeill Whistler — “Arrangement in Grey and Black No. 1” (Whistler’s Mother):** A near three-value Notan where the dress and background frame fuse into one dark shape, the wall stays mid-gray, and the face and cuff act as controlled lights.[^vaa-notan]
- **Claude Monet:** Certain seascapes and the “Argenteuil” series simplify to almost two values, proving that even high-key Impressionist work can maintain decisive value groups.[^vaa-notan]
- **Modern graphic examples:** Comic artist Mike Mignola, film noir cinematography, and many poster designers rely on stark dark-vs-light silhouettes—the same Notan principles applied to contemporary storytelling.

The shared lesson: when you squint at masterworks, the compositions still read as bold light/dark patterns, confirming that value grouping underpins their impact.

#### Practice Drills to Improve Notan Awareness
1. **Two-value thumbnails:** Gather three to five references with clear lighting. In 2–3 inch thumbnails, spend under five minutes blocking each scene in pure black and white. Stay zoomed out and compare your abstractions with the originals to judge clarity.
2. **Notan variations:** Take one composition and explore multiple value arrangements. Try the subject light against a dark background in one version, dark against light in another, or introduce a third value to support secondary elements. Evaluate which pattern best delivers the intended mood.
3. **Master-copy Notans:** Choose paintings or film stills famous for dramatic lighting (Caravaggio, Rembrandt, film noir). Copy only their value design in black and white, noticing how large masses interlock to highlight focal points.

*More ideas:* Draw a Notan from memory after a ten-second glance at a scene; photograph your surroundings and apply a threshold filter before redrawing the design by hand; or paint a Notan on top of your own work-in-progress to diagnose muddy passages. Consistent drills build instinct so you naturally spot light/dark groupings in daily life and plan them before diving into color.

#### Conclusion
Notan design and disciplined value grouping give compositions instant readability and expressive control. By simplifying values into a handful of masses, grouping lights with lights and darks with darks, and rationing high contrast to the focal point, you build images that hold up at any size. Keep Notan thumbnails in your workflow—iterate quickly, audit your paintings in grayscale or threshold view, and protect the value map as you refine details. The result is artwork that communicates clearly, much like the masterworks you admire.

## Chapter 8 — When to break the rule (on purpose)

- Center the subject for power, symmetry, or an uncanny graphic feel.
- Crush the horizon (all sky or all ground) to exaggerate mood.
- Smother with negative space for isolation or stylized minimalism.

Even rule-of-thirds advocates stress it’s guidance, not law—use it until you can
explain why you’re breaking it.

## Chapter 9 — 15-minute practice loop (do these today)

- **A/B/C crops:** Center vs. left third vs. right third. Note how the mood shifts.
- **Horizon study:** Shoot the same scene with the horizon on top vs. bottom third.
  Pick the better story.
- **Lead-room flip:** Portrait facing left; place on right third (comfortable) vs. left
  third (crowded). Feel the difference.
- **2-value Notan:** Reduce a WIP to black/white shapes and adjust until the focal
  path is unmistakable.

## Chapter 10 — Set up helpful guides in your apps

- **Clip Studio Paint:** Use the Straight Ruler with “Equal Division = 3,” or divide a
  frame folder 3×3 for a reusable overlay.
- **Procreate:** Actions → Canvas → Drawing Guide → Edit → 2D Grid. Enter exact pixel
  values so gridlines fall on thirds (the guide defaults to squares).
