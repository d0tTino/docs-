# Introduction: The Problem of "Good Enough" in Artistic Practice

## The Artist's Backlog: A Phenomenon without a Name

Within the discourse of artistic practice, a common yet underserved phenomenon persists: the
accumulation of passages that are knowingly deferred. Artists, educators, and students often
reference a backlog of elements—hands, feet, complex drapery, secondary figures, or background
details—that remain in a "good-enough-for-now" state. The strategy keeps momentum on primary
subjects but frequently backfires, draining energy and compromising coherence during the finishing
stage. Critically, the vocabulary available to discuss this issue is either informal and judgmental
("lazy," "sloppy," "avoidance") or imported from productivity discourse ill-suited to formal
critique. The absence of neutral, precise terminology obscures intent, making it difficult to
distinguish deliberate artistic choices from unintentional deficiencies.

# Deconstructing the Metaphor: "Technical Debt" in its Original Context

Software developer Ward Cunningham coined "technical debt" in 1992 as a strategic metaphor rather
than a pejorative description of poor craftsmanship. The analogy clarified to non-technical
stakeholders why a team might ship imperfect first-time code: it was a conscious loan that allowed
the team to deliver early, gain experience, and incorporate market feedback. Crucially, the metaphor
assumes prompt repayment through refactoring—updating internal code structure without changing
external behavior.

The metaphor aligns around three parts:

- **The loan**: a deliberate shortcut to achieve a short-term milestone, such as shipping a release.
- **The interest**: ongoing costs paid whenever developers work around the shortcut, slowing future progress.
- **The repayment**: the refactoring effort that eliminates the shortcut and restores productivity.

Cunningham's framing embedded intent and strategy. Debt was incurred knowingly with a repayment
plan. Over time, the term has been diluted to mean "any mess left behind when team members rush
through their code base," obscuring its original nuance. This erosion parallels art criticism's
challenge: differentiating intentional, aesthetically motivated choices from neglect. Just as
engineers wrestle with distinguishing strategic debt from chaos, art critics confront the blurred
line between deliberate _non finito_ and mere incompletion. Both domains reveal the need for a
shared vocabulary that separates intent from outcome.

# Mapping the Metaphor to Artistic Practice (and Its Limits)

Translating the metaphor to studio practice yields useful parallels. An artist's "loan" might be
blocking in a complex background with simplified masses to preserve energy for the focal figure. The
"interest" manifests as later difficulty reconciling that background with the rendered figure,
potentially disrupting the finish. The "repayment" is the return to refine forms, values, and edges
so the passage harmonizes with the whole.

Yet paintings are not continuously iterated products. Startups can ship updates indefinitely; a
singular artwork aims toward a definitive statement. Moreover, a seemingly deferred passage may be
the artist's final decision. Soft backgrounds, lost edges, or simplified shadow masses often
constitute sophisticated compositional strategies that direct the eye. The metaphor therefore
functions best as a prompt: how do we distinguish passages that are compositionally justified in
their lower finish from those that are genuinely unresolved? The remainder of this report constructs
a precise, neutral vocabulary rooted in art history, criticism, and pedagogy to answer that
question.

# A Critical Glossary of Finish and Compositional Intent

## The Spectrum of Finish: From Sketch to Finality

Degree of finish exists on a continuum rather than as a binary. Artist and author James Gurney
argues the real metric of completion is whether the artist's inner conception is fully realized.
Facture—visible brushwork or polish—is secondary to communicative intent. Historical media further
complicate surface expectations: egg tempera's matte quick-drying properties invite crisp detail,
whereas oil's slow drying allows glazing and blending.

Distinguishing a finished work from a preparatory one is essential. Sketches and studies exist as
means to an end, and their low finish suits that purpose. The same surface treatment in a work
intended for exhibition warrants scrutiny relative to the artist's broader aesthetic goals.

## Unfinishedness vs. _Non Finito_: The Question of Intent

The Metropolitan Museum of Art's exhibition _Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible_ provides a framework
for separating accidental incompletion from intentional openness.

- **Unfinishedness** describes accidental interruption: illness, death, abandoned commissions, or logistical failures. Alice Neel's _James Hunter Black Draftee_ (1965) remained incomplete when the sitter was drafted for the Vietnam War.
- **_Non finito_** is an aesthetic strategy. The term signals a deliberate cultivation of unresolved passages to highlight selected features by omission. Rooted in Platonic philosophy, it flourished with Renaissance artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Titian. For these painters, over-finishing could destroy atmosphere; restraint signaled mastery.

## The Principle of Visual Hierarchy: The "Why" of Selective Finish

Visual hierarchy organizes elements to indicate their relative significance. Effective compositions
guide the viewer's gaze through focal points established via contrast, scale, placement, or
directional cues. By definition, focal points demand that other areas remain subordinate. Unequal
finish is therefore a fundamental design principle, not an incidental artifact.

## The Mechanics of Hierarchy I: Value Structure and Grouping

Value, or tone, measures lightness and darkness. Compositions built from simplified value
families—value grouping or massing—maintain clarity at thumbnail scale. Artists intentionally
restrict contrast in secondary areas, welding lights with lights or darks with darks, while
reserving the sharpest value jumps for focal passages. A background compressed into a single dark
mass often signals sophisticated design, not neglect.

## The Mechanics of Hierarchy II: Edge Control and Atmospheric Effects

Edges range from hard to lost and play a decisive role in focus and depth:

- **Hard edges** carry high contrast, demanding attention and advancing forms.
- **Soft edges** blur transitions, suggesting curvature or atmosphere that lets forms recede.
- **Lost edges** merge shapes of similar value, inviting viewers to complete implied forms and reinforcing unity.

Techniques such as **sfumato**—Leonardo's "smoky" gradations achieved by subtle tonal modulation—and
**aerial perspective**—the atmospheric rule that distant forms lose contrast, color intensity, and
detail—codify these principles. Both justify lower finish in non-focal areas by design.

# A Decision Framework: Distinguishing Design from Deferment

## Proposing a Neutral Terminology

This report introduces two central terms:

- **Under-resolved area**: a passage rendered below the work's established finish baseline without clear compositional justification via hierarchy, value structure, or edge control.
- **Selective finish**: the intentional reduction of detail, contrast, or edge sharpness in non-focal areas to reinforce the composition's hierarchy.

Together with _non finito_ and incomplete work, these definitions produce a comprehensive vocabulary
for unfinishedness.

## A Two-Step Test for Analysis

1. **Establish the baseline degree of finish.** Identify focal points and assess their highest detail, sharpest edges, and strongest contrasts. These passages signal the artist's technical ambition.
2. **Justify the deviation.** Evaluate lower-finish areas against compositional functions:
   - **Hierarchy and depth**: Do softened passages aid recession through aerial perspective or edge modulation?
   - **Value structure**: Does simplification merge with larger value masses that strengthen focal contrast?
   - **Emphasis**: Does reduced finish direct attention toward the center of interest?

If evidence supports these functions, classify the passage as selective finish. If not, it likely
constitutes an under-resolved area.

## Table 1: Lexicon Mapping — From Colloquialism to Critical Terminology

| Colloquial Term | Proposed Critical Term | Definition & Criteria for Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "Technical Debt" (Strategic Deferment) | Selective Finish / Selective Rendering | Intentional reduction of detail, contrast, or edge sharpness in a non-focal area, justified by visual hierarchy principles (value grouping, edge control, aerial perspective). |
| "Lazy," "Sloppy," "Technical Debt" (Mess) | Under-Resolved Area | Passage below the established finish baseline without clear compositional justification; appears deferred rather than intentionally subordinated. |
| "Unfinished" (Intentional Aesthetic) | _Non Finito_ | Deliberate decision to keep the entire work or significant sections open-ended to engage the viewer's imagination and emphasize process. |
| "Unfinished" (Accidental) | Incomplete Work | Work halted by external, non-artistic circumstances (e.g., illness, interrupted commissions). |

# A Taxonomy of Common Under-Resolution Types

Applying the decision framework enables targeted diagnosis:

## Anatomical Under-Resolution

- **Proportional errors**: heads, hands, or feet rendered at inconsistent scales.
- **Structural misunderstanding**: figures lacking skeletal or muscular logic (e.g., shoulders detached from the clavicle, cylindrical "sausage" limbs).
- **Lack of form**: flat outlines that ignore three-dimensional volumes.

## Structural & Perspectival Under-Resolution

- **Geometric inconsistencies**: architecture or objects misaligned with the chosen perspective system.
- **Anachronistic critique**: recognizing that pre-Renaissance works may intentionally break linear perspective (e.g., hieratic scale) and must be evaluated contextually.
- **Symbolic deviations**: Renaissance artists occasionally employed "defective" perspective deliberately (e.g., Domenico Veneziano's emblematic door). Under-resolution occurs when inconsistencies lack higher-order rationale.

## Tonal Under-Resolution

- **"Spotty" compositions** with scattered values that resist cohesion.
- **Absent focal points** due to uniform contrast across the canvas.
- **Poor readability** in thumbnails, indicating weak value massing.

## Surface & Edge Under-Resolution

- **Cut-out effect** from uniformly hard edges that flatten space.
- **Indiscriminate detail** distributing texture evenly, undermining hierarchy.

# Case Studies in Selective Finish and Under-Resolution

## Leonardo da Vinci, _Ginevra de' Benci_ (c. 1474/1478)

The portrait establishes its baseline through the meticulously rendered facial features. Peripheral
elements—hair curls, juniper foliage, distant landscape—exhibit softened, atmospheric handling.
Leonardo's sfumato, even incorporating fingerprint blending, and his application of aerial
perspective confirm these passages as selective finish supporting the focal point.

## J.M.W. Turner, _Norham Castle, Sunrise_ (c. 1845)

Turner's late work eschews a singular focal baseline in favor of unified luminosity. The canvas
dissolves form into color washes; critics initially decried this as "botched" execution. Later
reassessments recognized intentional _non finito_ that pursues sensory experience over description,
positioning the work as a precursor to Impressionism and abstraction.

## Johannes Vermeer, _Girl with the Pearl Earring_ (c. 1665)

The crisp rendering of eyes, lips, and the pearl defines the finish baseline. Yet the contour where
the cheek meets the dark ground is subtly softened, likely via scumbling. This controlled edge
modulation turns the form in space, exemplifying selective finish through edge hierarchy.

## John Singer Sargent, _Two Girls Fishing_ (1912)

Sargent's figures set the baseline. Surrounding rocks, foliage, and water flatten into unified value
masses. The deliberate simplification welds large darks and lights, allowing the figures to command
attention—textbook value grouping in service of selective finish.

## Rembrandt van Rijn, _The Great Jewish Bride_ (1635)

State II of the etching reveals a working hierarchy: the bride receives dense cross-hatching and
psychological focus, while architectural elements remain schematic. Rather than under-resolution,
this state documents selective finish in progress, emphasizing the efficient prioritization of focal
passages.

## Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, _Grande Odalisque_ (1814)

Ingres's elongated anatomy conflicts with the painting's otherwise hyper-real finish baseline.
However, the distortions can be interpreted as intentional stylization that prioritizes a sinuous
serpentine line over anatomical accuracy. The case underscores the interpretive nuance required when
applying the framework.

# Conclusion: Toward a More Precise Critical Language

## Summary of Findings

The lack of neutral terminology for deferred passages in artworks mirrors the degradation of
"technical debt" in software discourse. By distinguishing between incomplete works, _non finito_,
selective finish, and under-resolved areas, critics gain a vocabulary rooted in art-historical
precedent. The two-step analytical framework grounds evaluations in observable evidence—finish
baselines and compositional justification—rather than subjective judgment.

## Implications

- **Critique**: Enables constructive, evidence-based feedback (e.g., identifying "tonal under-resolution" rather than labeling work "sloppy").
- **Pedagogy**: Provides educators with concrete language for teaching hierarchy, encouraging students to control finish intentionally.
- **Art history**: Supports re-evaluation of works historically dismissed as incomplete, revealing sophisticated strategies beneath apparent looseness.

## Concluding Statement

Enriching critical vocabulary deepens our understanding of artistic decision-making. Moving from the
ambiguity of "technical debt" to the clarity of "under-resolution" and "selective finish" equips
practitioners, critics, and scholars to appreciate not only what appears on the surface but why
those choices were made.
