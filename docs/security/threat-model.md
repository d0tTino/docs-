# Documentation and Scripts Threat Model

## Assets

- Public documentation site
- Build and deployment scripts
- Source repository and configuration

The diagram below illustrates how documentation moves from contributors through the build pipeline to public users.

<figure aria-label="Documentation flows from developers and their repository through CI to a static site that is hosted for public users.">
<div class="mermaid">

    subgraph Contributors["Trust Boundary: Contributors"]
        D[Developers]
        R[Repository]
    end
    subgraph Build["Trust Boundary: CI"]
        C[CI builds docs]
        S[Static site generated]
    end
    subgraph Public["Trust Boundary: Public"]
        H[Hosting]
        U[Users]
    end

    D --> R --> C --> S --> H --> U

</figure>

**Boundary legend:**

- **Contributors** â€” Developer space and repository where docs originate.
- **CI** â€” Automated system that builds the documentation site.
- **Public** â€” Hosting environment delivering the static site to users.

**Diagram description:** Developers work within the Contributors boundary and commit documentation to the repository. After review, changes cross into the CI boundary where the system builds the docs into a static site. The resulting site then crosses the trust boundary into the Public environment for hosting and user access.

## Potential Threats

| Threat                                          | Impact | Likelihood | Severity | Mitigation                                             | Status    |
|-------------------------------------------------|--------|------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Unauthorized modification or defacement of docs | Medium | Medium     | ðŸŸ§ Medium | Use version control; require code review to gate changes| Monitored |
| Malicious code injection in scripts             | High   | Low        | ðŸŸ¥ High   | Restrict script permissions; validate dependencies      | Mitigated |
| Leakage of credentials or sensitive data        | High   | Low        | ðŸŸ¥ High   | Scan commits for secrets; rotate credentials regularly  | Mitigated |
**Severity legend:**

- ðŸŸ© Low
- ðŸŸ§ Medium
- ðŸŸ¥ High

### Verification Steps

- **Unauthorized modification or defacement of docs**
  - Confirm each pull request has at least one reviewer.
  - Run [`scripts/setup_hooks.sh`](../../scripts/setup_hooks.sh) to enable repository-specific hooks.
- **Malicious code injection in scripts**
  - Verify script files have appropriate execute permissions.
  - Audit dependencies with `npm audit` (see [package.json](../../package.json)) and `pip install --require-hashes -r` [`requirements.txt`](../../requirements.txt).
- **Leakage of credentials or sensitive data**
  - Scan commits with [GitLeaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) or similar tools before merging.
  - Rotate credentials according to the organization's security policy.
