# Documentation and Scripts Threat Model

## Assets

- Public documentation site
- Build and deployment scripts
- Source repository and configuration

The diagram below illustrates how documentation moves from contributors through the build pipeline to public users.

    subgraph Contributors["Trust Boundary: Contributors"]
        D[Developers]
        R[Repository]
    end
    subgraph Build["Trust Boundary: CI"]
        C[CI builds docs]
        S[Static site generated]
    end
    subgraph Public["Trust Boundary: Public"]
        H[Hosting]
        U[Users]
    end

    D --> R --> C --> S --> H --> U
```

## Potential Threats

| Threat | Impact | Likelihood | Severity | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Unauthorized modification or defacement of docs | Medium | Medium | Medium | Use version control; require code review to gate changes |
| Malicious code injection in scripts | High | Low | High | Restrict script permissions; validate dependencies |
| Leakage of credentials or sensitive data | High | Low | High | Scan commits for secrets; rotate credentials regularly |

### Verification Steps

- **Unauthorized modification or defacement of docs**
  - Confirm each pull request has at least one reviewer.
  - Run [`scripts/setup_hooks.sh`](../../scripts/setup_hooks.sh) to enable repository-specific hooks.
- **Malicious code injection in scripts**
  - Verify script files have appropriate execute permissions.
  - Audit dependencies with `npm audit` (see [package.json](../../package.json)) and `pip install --require-hashes -r` [`requirements.txt`](../../requirements.txt).
- **Leakage of credentials or sensitive data**
  - Scan commits with [GitLeaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) or similar tools before merging.
  - Rotate credentials according to the organization's security policy.
