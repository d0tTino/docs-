# Documentation and Scripts Threat Model

## Assets

- Public documentation site
- Build and deployment scripts
- Source repository and configuration

The diagram below illustrates how documentation moves from contributors through the build pipeline to public users.

![Documentation flows from developers and their repository through CI to a static site that is hosted for public users, showing trust boundaries and the direction of data flow.](threat-model.svg)

*Flow of documentation from developers to users via CI and hosting.*

**Boundary legend:**

- **Contributors** â€” Developer space and repository where docs originate.
- **CI** â€” Automated system that builds the documentation site.
- **Public** â€” Hosting environment delivering the static site to users.

**Diagram description:** Developers work within the Contributors boundary and commit documentation to the repository. After review, changes cross into the CI boundary where the system builds the docs into a static site. The resulting site then crosses the trust boundary into the Public environment for hosting and user access.

## Potential Threats

| Threat | Impact | Likelihood | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|--------|--------|------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Unauthorized doc changes or defacement | Medium | Medium | ðŸŸ§ Medium | Version control and review | Monitored |
| Script injection | High | Low | ðŸŸ¥ High | <ul><li>Restrict permissions</li><li>Validate deps</li></ul> | Mitigated |
| Credential leak | High | Low | ðŸŸ¥ High | <ul><li>Scan for secrets</li><li>Rotate credentials</li></ul> | Mitigated |

- ðŸŸ© Low
- ðŸŸ§ Medium
- ðŸŸ¥ High

### Verification Steps

- **Unauthorized modification or defacement of docs**
  - Confirm each pull request has at least one reviewer.
  - Run [`scripts/setup_hooks.sh`](../../scripts/setup_hooks.sh) to enable repository-specific hooks.
- **Malicious code injection in scripts**
  - Verify script files have appropriate execute permissions.
  - Audit dependencies with `npm audit` (see [package.json](../../package.json)) and `pip install --require-hashes -r` [`requirements.txt`](../../requirements.txt).
- **Leakage of credentials or sensitive data**
  - Scan commits with [GitLeaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) or similar tools before merging.
  - Rotate credentials according to the organization's security policy.
