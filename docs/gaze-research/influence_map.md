# Influence Map

Below is a vector diagram mapping key theorists and gaze variants.

![Influence map illustrating theoretical lineage of gaze theories](influence-map.svg)

*Figure: The map links [Lacan](gaze_bibliography.md#lacan-and-psychoanalysis)â€™s psychoanalytic gaze through [Foucault](gaze_bibliography.md#medical-and-surveillance-studies), [Mulvey](gaze_bibliography.md#film-and-gender-studies), and [hooks](gaze_bibliography.md#film-and-gender-studies) to the [algorithmic gaze](gaze_bibliography.md#medical-and-surveillance-studies).*

## Legend

- Pink nodes (e.g., [Lacan](gaze_bibliography.md#lacan-and-psychoanalysis)) denote psychoanalytic foundations.
- Blue nodes (e.g., [Foucault](gaze_bibliography.md#medical-and-surveillance-studies)) mark post-structural power analyses.
- Orange nodes (e.g., [Mulvey](gaze_bibliography.md#film-and-gender-studies)) represent feminist film theory.
- Green nodes (e.g., [hooks](gaze_bibliography.md#film-and-gender-studies)) highlight intersectional feminism.
- Gray node ([algorithmic gaze](gaze_bibliography.md#medical-and-surveillance-studies)) indicates contemporary digital extensions.
- Arrows show the direction of theoretical influence from earlier to later thinkers.
