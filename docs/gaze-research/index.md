# Gaze Research

This project examines how classical, feminist, and algorithmic theories of the gaze intersect across media and platform surveillance, outlining the scope for subsequent deliverables.

This section collects deliverables for the project "From Mirror to Feed: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Gaze—Classical Theory, Contemporary Extensions, and the Emergent Social‑Media Gaze."

## Deliverables

- [Main Report](gaze_report.md): Provides the project's full analytical narrative across classical, feminist, and algorithmic gaze theories.
- [Annotated Bibliography](gaze_bibliography.md): Offers commentary and context for key sources used in the study.
- [Influence Map](influence_map.md): Visualizes conceptual relationships among thinkers and ideas surrounding the gaze.
- [BibTeX References](gaze_references.bib): Supplies machine-readable citations for further research.
