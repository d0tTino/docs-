## Project Overview

This document consolidates all deliverables for the research project.

The project, "From Mirror to Feed: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Gaze—Classical Theory, Contemporary Extensions, and the Emergent Social‑Media Gaze," examines the gaze across historical and contemporary perspectives.

### Summary

- Consolidates all deliverables for the gaze research project.
- Analyzes the gaze from classical theory to social-media contexts.

## Deliverables Overview

| Deliverable | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Main Report | A ~10k word report covering Abstract, Introduction, Theoretical Framework, Methods, Findings, Discussion, and Conclusion. | [gaze_report.md](gaze_report.md) |
| Annotated Bibliography | A one-paragraph annotation for each major source cited in the report, summarising content, methodological quality, and relevance. | [gaze_bibliography.md](gaze_bibliography.md) |
| Influence Map | A vector graphic mapping the theoretical lineage of the gaze; nodes represent theorists and gaze variants, with arrows indicating influence. | [influence_map.md](influence_map.md) |
| BibTeX References | A file for citation management that can be imported into reference software (e.g., Zotero, EndNote). | [gaze_references.bib](gaze_references.bib) |

### Summary

- Main report covers theory, methods, findings, and conclusions.
- Bibliography and references streamline citation management.
- Influence map visualizes theoretical lineage.

## Using the Deliverables

### Reading the Report

- Open `gaze_report.md` in any markdown viewer to read the full analysis.
- Citations use BibTeX keys (e.g., [@lacan_sep]) that map to
  `gaze_references.bib`.

### Exploring Sources

- Consult `gaze_bibliography.md` for annotated summaries of major sources.
- Use citation keys in the annotations or `gaze_references.bib` for complete
  publication details.

### Visualising the Genealogy

- The influence map in `influence_map.md` illustrates how theoretical concepts
  shaped one another over time.

### Reference Management

- Import `gaze_references.bib` into reference management software to generate
  formatted citations.
- Entries contain minimal bibliographic data and may require additional
  details.

### Summary

- Report and citations can be read with standard markdown and BibTeX tools.
- Bibliography and references provide detailed source information.
- Influence map reveals relationships among theoretical concepts.

## Notes

- The comparative matrix of gaze variants is integrated into the main report (Section 5) rather than provided as a separate file.
- The report highlights research gaps and suggests future work, including empirical studies on non-Western and neuro-diverse populations.
- It also calls for exploration of emerging technologies such as AR/VR and generative AI.
- Due to the topic's breadth and limited open access, not all primary texts could be directly quoted; secondary summaries were used where appropriate.
- Readers are encouraged to consult original works for deeper analysis.

### Summary

- Comparative matrix appears in Section 5.
- Emphasizes research gaps, diverse populations, and emerging technologies.
- Encourages consultation of original texts.
