# Gaze Research Project – Comprehensive Document

This document consolidates all deliverables for the research project "From Mirror to Feed: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Gaze—Classical Theory, Contemporary Extensions, and the Emergent Social‑Media Gaze."

## Deliverables Overview

- **Main Report (`gaze_report.md`)** – A ~10k word report covering Abstract, Introduction, Theoretical Framework, Methods, Findings, Discussion, and Conclusion.
- **Annotated Bibliography (`gaze_bibliography.md`)** – A one-paragraph annotation for each major source cited in the report, summarising content, methodological quality, and relevance.
- **Influence Map (`influence_map.md`)** – A vector graphic mapping the theoretical lineage of the gaze; nodes represent theorists and gaze variants, arrows indicate influence.
- **BibTeX References (`gaze_references.bib`)** – A file for citation management that can be imported into reference software (e.g., Zotero, EndNote).

## Using the Deliverables

**Reading the report:** Open `gaze_report.md` in any markdown viewer to read the full analysis. Citations use BibTeX keys (e.g., [@lacan_sep]), which point to specific lines in the sources consulted during research.

**Exploring sources:** The annotated bibliography in `gaze_bibliography.md` gives an overview of each major source. For full details and to trace the original passages, consult the citation keys in the annotations or see the BibTeX references for publication information.

**Visualising the genealogy:** The influence map in `influence_map.md` shows how theoretical concepts influenced one another over time.

**Reference management:** The `gaze_references.bib` file can be imported into reference management software to generate formatted citations. The entries contain minimal bibliographic data and may need supplemental details.

## Notes

- The comparative matrix of gaze variants is integrated into the main report (Section 5) rather than provided as a separate file.
- The report identifies research gaps and proposes directions for future work, including the need for empirical studies on non‑Western and neuro‑diverse populations and on emerging technologies such as AR/VR and generative AI.
- Due to the breadth of the topic and the limitations of open access, not all primary texts could be directly quoted; secondary summaries were used where appropriate. Readers are encouraged to consult original works for deeper analysis.
