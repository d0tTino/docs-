# Gaze Research Project – Comprehensive Document

This document consolidates all deliverables for the research project
"From Mirror to Feed: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Gaze—Classical
Theory, Contemporary Extensions, and the Emergent Social‑Media Gaze."

## Deliverables Overview

- **Main Report (`gaze_report.md`)** – A ~10k word report covering
  Abstract, Introduction, Theoretical Framework, Methods, Findings,
  Discussion, and Conclusion.
- **Annotated Bibliography (`gaze_bibliography.md`)** – A one-paragraph
  annotation for each major source cited in the report, summarising
  content, methodological quality, and relevance.
- **Influence Map (`influence_map.md`)** – A vector graphic mapping the
  theoretical lineage of the gaze; nodes represent theorists and gaze
  variants, arrows indicate influence.
- **BibTeX References (`gaze_references.bib`)** – A file for citation
  management that can be imported into reference software (e.g., Zotero,
  EndNote).

## Using the Deliverables

### Reading the Report

- Open `gaze_report.md` in any markdown viewer to read the full analysis.
- Citations use BibTeX keys (e.g., [@lacan_sep]) that map to
  `gaze_references.bib`.

### Exploring Sources

- Consult `gaze_bibliography.md` for annotated summaries of major sources.
- Use citation keys in the annotations or `gaze_references.bib` for complete
  publication details.

### Visualising the Genealogy

- The influence map in `influence_map.md` illustrates how theoretical concepts
  shaped one another over time.

### Reference Management

- Import `gaze_references.bib` into reference management software to generate
  formatted citations.
- Entries contain minimal bibliographic data and may require additional
  details.

## Notes

- The comparative matrix of gaze variants is integrated into the main report
  (Section 5) rather than provided as a separate file.
- The report identifies research gaps and proposes directions for future work,
  including the need for empirical studies on non-Western and neuro-diverse
  populations and on emerging technologies such as AR/VR and generative AI.
- Due to the breadth of the topic and the limitations of open access, not all
  primary texts could be directly quoted; secondary summaries were used where
  appropriate. Readers are encouraged to consult original works for deeper
  analysis.
