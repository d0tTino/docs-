**Visualising the genealogy:** The influence map embedded in this document shows how theoretical concepts influenced one another over time.

**Reference management:** The BibTeX section at the end of this document can be copied into reference management software to generate formatted citations. The entries contain minimal bibliographic data and may need supplemental details.

## Notes

- The comparative matrix of gaze variants is integrated into the main report (Section 5) rather than provided as a separate file.
- The report identifies research gaps and proposes directions for future work, including the need for empirical studies on non‑Western and neuro‑diverse populations and on emerging technologies such as AR/VR and generative AI.
- Due to the breadth of the topic and the limitations of open access, not all primary texts could be directly quoted; secondary summaries were used where appropriate. Readers are encouraged to consult original works for deeper analysis.

## Annotated Bibliography

Below is a list of key sources used in the preparation of this report. Each annotation summarises the source’s content, assesses its methodological quality and explains its relevance to the study of the gaze.

### Lacan and Psychoanalysis

- **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy – “Jacques Lacan”** (<https://plato.stanford.edu>). This article provides a comprehensive overview of Lacan’s mirror stage and his reinterpretation of the Oedipus complex. It explains how the mirror stage creates a misrecognised ego when the infant identifies with an ideal image, thereby illuminating the gaze as identity‑forming. The entry is peer‑reviewed and suitable for referencing core Lacanian concepts.

- **Foucault, M. – *The Birth of the Clinic*** (summary in In-Training article by Lange & Lu, <https://in-training.org>). This summary distils Foucault’s concept of the medical gaze. It describes how nineteenth‑century physicians shifted from anecdotal diagnoses to empirical observation and how Foucault conceptualised the “double system” of observation that traverses the patient’s body. The article is an accessible secondary source but stays close to Foucault’s primary text.

### Film and Gender Studies

- **Mulvey, L. – “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema” (1975)** (summarised at <https://media-studies.com>). Mulvey’s essay introduces the male gaze, arguing that mainstream cinema caters to a heterosexual male viewer. It outlines how women become passive objects of spectacle. The summary captures key quotations and is widely used in film studies.

- **Female Gaze – NYU Press Blog** (<https://nyupress.org>). This article explains the female gaze as focusing on agency, depth and authenticity. It argues that the female gaze dismantles androcentric boundaries and encourages diverse storytelling. Although a popular blog, it draws upon feminist film scholarship and provides an accessible introduction.

- **Wikipedia – “Female gaze” entry** (<https://en.wikipedia.org>). Offers a concise definition of the female gaze and outlines its relation to Mulvey’s male gaze. Though not peer‑reviewed, it serves as an introductory reference and points to primary sources.

- **hooks, b. – “The Oppositional Gaze: Black Female Spectatorship” (1992)** (summary at <https://en.wikipedia.org>). hooks argues that Black women develop an oppositional gaze that challenges dominant representations and claims the right to look. The summary highlights her critique of both white cinema and male gaze theory. The original essay is a seminal feminist text; the secondary summary accurately reflects its arguments.

- **Queer Gaze – 3AM Magazine** (<https://3ammagazine.com>). The article discusses how the queer gaze deconstructs binary gender assumptions and emphasises fluid identities. It critiques mainstream LGBT cinema for replicating heteronormative frameworks and calls for more radical queer aesthetics. The piece is an opinion essay but grounded in queer theory.

- **Kaplan, E. A. – *Looking for the Other: Feminism, Film and the Imperial Gaze* (1997)** (summary of the imperial gaze in <https://en.wikipedia.org>). This synopsis describes how the imperial gaze defines the colonised through the observer’s values and assumes the centrality of the white Western subject. It is consistent with Kaplan’s argument in her book, although readers should consult the full text for depth.

### Post‑Colonial and Tourism Studies

- **IGI Global – “Colonial Gaze”** (<https://igi-global.com>). Defines the colonial gaze as a mechanism for dehumanising colonised subjects and legitimising coloniser dominance. The entry notes that this gaze operates in health and education systems. It provides a succinct description and references Fanon and Bhabha, making it suitable for introductory purposes.

- **Number Analytics – “Tourist Gaze”** (<https://abacademies.org>). Summarises John Urry’s concept that tourists’ perceptions are socially constructed and shaped by cultural expectations of authenticity and exoticism. The article notes the Western bias of the tourist gaze and introduces variations such as tourist‑initiated and host‑initiated gazes.

### Medical and Surveillance Studies

- **PubMed Central – Article on the Medical Gaze** (<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>). Discusses how physicians fit patient narratives into biomedical paradigms, filtering out subjective experiences. The article highlights that those in power set agendas and that Foucault’s medical gaze remains relevant in contemporary psychiatry. It is peer‑reviewed and offers empirical examples.

- **Foucault – “Panopticism”** (<https://staff.kings.edu>). Provides a primary exposition of the panopticon design and Foucault’s analysis of how visibility becomes a mechanism of control. The excerpt explains that surveillance is visible yet unverifiable and causes inmates to internalise discipline. An essential text for understanding modern surveillance.

- **Sustainability Directory – “Algorithmic Gaze”** (<https://fashion.sustainability-directory.com>). Defines the algorithmic gaze as the interpretive lens through which algorithms perceive and process data. It notes that algorithms actively filter and prioritise information, shaping decisions in complex systems, and warns that the gaze is not neutral. Useful for framing the digital extension of the gaze.

- **Oak Interactive – “The Invisible Architects: How Algorithms Shape Our World”** (<https://oakinteractive.com>). A business article describing how AI algorithms personalise content and create echo chambers. It emphasises that algorithms benefit consumers by tailoring experiences but also reinforce biases. While not academic, it articulates public concerns and contextualises algorithmic power.

- **Psychology Today – “The Digital Observer”** (<https://psychologytoday.com>). Explores the psychological consequences of being observed by algorithms. It argues that digital surveillance shifts individuals from self‑inquiry to self‑editing, encouraging compliance with unseen criteria. The article blends psychology and media critique, offering insights into internalised surveillance.

### Empirical Studies on Social Media

- **BMC Psychology – “Psychological Drivers of Online Self‑Presentation” (2025)** (<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>). Reports a survey of 367 U.S. social media users and finds that exposure to curated posts leads to upward social comparison and FOMO, which in turn drive self‑presentation. It differentiates between friend‑dominated and stranger‑dominated networks. The study uses validated measures and offers quantitative effect sizes, making it a valuable data point.

- **Nature Communications – “Authentic Self‑Expression on Social Media” (2020)** (<https://nature.com>). Uses personality assessments and Facebook data to quantify authenticity and finds that greater alignment between self‑view and online expression correlates with higher life satisfaction. The research employs large‑scale data and robust statistical methods.

- **ArXiv – “Empirical Audit of Reddit’s r/popular Feed” (2022)** (<https://arxiv.org>). Audits Reddit’s algorithmic ranking and finds that recent comments help posts remain visible while undesirable behaviour does not prolong exposure. The study demonstrates how small algorithmic choices affect visibility and engagement. It uses a large dataset (10k posts) and provides transparent code.

- **Semantic Scholar – “Algorithmic Folk Theories and Identity”** (<https://semanticscholar.org>). Summarises a 2021 ACM paper showing that users’ beliefs about how TikTok’s algorithm works influence their sense of belonging and their perceived ability to be seen. Highlights that folk theories shape user behaviour even when they are inaccurate.

- **Behavioral Sciences – “False Self‑Presentation and Social Comparison in Excessive Social Media Use” (2025)** (<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>). Applies self‑discrepancy and social‑comparison theories to analyse how false self‑presentation and comparison drive excessive social‑media use. The study finds that false self‑presentation increases fear of negative evaluation but does not directly increase usage; social comparison is a stronger driver. The paper uses structural equation modelling and discusses gender moderation effects.

### Algorithmic and Social Drivers

- **Perspectives on Psychological Science – “Social Drivers and Algorithmic Mechanisms on Digital Media” (2024)** (<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>). A comprehensive review that examines how algorithms interact with human motives for connection and status. It emphasises that algorithms often reinforce existing social drivers rather than introduce new ones, identifies risks such as depression and polarisation, and calls for design changes to promote well‑being. The article is peer‑reviewed and synthesises evidence from multiple disciplines.

### Additional Sources

- **Urry, J. – *The Tourist Gaze* (1990)** (summarised at <https://abacademies.org>). Although not directly accessed in full, secondary summaries capture Urry’s argument that tourist perceptions are socially constructed and influenced by expectations of authenticity and exoticism. The book is a seminal text in tourism studies.

- **Fan Culture and Algorithmic Curation – Oak Interactive and other grey literature** (<https://oakinteractive.com>). Provide context for the public discourse on algorithms shaping experiences, highlighting echo chambers and filter bubbles.

- **Psychiatry and the Medical Gaze – PubMed articles** (<https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov>). Offer empirical examples of how the medical gaze functions in modern clinical settings, emphasising the reduction of patient narratives to data and the power imbalance between doctor and patient.
