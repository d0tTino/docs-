# The Energy-Efficient Swarm: A Playbook for High-Density, Multi-Agent LLM Deployment on Consumer GPUs

## Section 1: The Foundation - Model Quantization for VRAM-Constrained Environments

The fundamental challenge in deploying a multi-agent system on a single consumer-grade GPU is
managing the finite video random-access memory (VRAM). The target hardware, an NVIDIA RTX 4080
SUPER, is equipped with 16 GB of VRAM. A standard 7-billion parameter Large Language Model (LLM) in
its native 16-bit floating-point (FP16) precision requires approximately 14 GB of VRAM for its
weights alone, making the deployment of even a single agent model, let alone a swarm of five or
more, an impossibility. Consequently, model quantization---the process of reducing the numerical
precision of a model's weights and potentially its activations---is not merely an optimization but a
foundational requirement. This section provides a rigorous analysis of the leading quantization
techniques, evaluates their impact on model reasoning capabilities, and culminates in a definitive
recommendation for the optimal format to enable a high-density swarm of 4-7B parameter class models
within the 16 GB VRAM envelope.
### 1.1 A Comparative Analysis: GGUF, AWQ, and the State of 4-Bit Quantization

The landscape of 4-bit quantization is dominated by several competing formats and methodologies, each with distinct
trade-offs in terms of performance, flexibility, and VRAM footprint. An understanding of these
trade-offs is critical to selecting the correct foundation for the system architecture.

| Format | VRAM (7B weights) | Accuracy vs FP16 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| FP16 (baseline) | ~14 GB | 0% drop |
| AWQ (4-bit) | ~4.5 GB | ~1–3% drop |
| GGUF (Q4_K_M) | ~4.5 GB* | ~2–5% drop |
| GPTQ (4-bit) | ~4.5 GB | ~2–6% drop |

*GGUF supports layer offloading to system RAM, allowing the VRAM footprint to be reduced further.*

Table 1.1: VRAM and accuracy trade-offs for common 4-bit quantization formats.

GGUF (GPT-Generated Unified Format): GGUF has emerged as a de facto standard in the local LLM
community, primarily due to its exceptional flexibility. Its core design principle is to be
backend-agnostic, enabling execution on both CPUs and GPUs. The most critical feature for this
project is its native support for layer-splitting, a technique where a model's layers can be
strategically divided between GPU VRAM and system RAM.^1 This allows for a granular trade-off between
performance and memory usage; the most frequently used and performance-critical layers (e.g.,
attention layers) can be loaded into VRAM for maximum speed, while less critical layers are offloaded
to the much larger, albeit slower, system RAM. This capability is expertly leveraged by inference
engines like llama.cpp, making GGUF the premier format for environments with severe VRAM
constraints.^1 AWQ (Activation-Aware Weight Quantization): AWQ is a sophisticated post-training
quantization (PTQ) method that operates on the principle that not all weights are equally important.
By analyzing the activation magnitudes during a calibration pass, AWQ identifies and preserves the
precision of "salient" weights that are most critical to the model's performance, while more
aggressively quantizing less important ones.[^awq] This activation-aware approach has proven particularly
effective for instruction-tuned and multi-modal LLMs, often yielding superior performance preservation
compared to more naive quantization schemes. AWQ is heavily optimized for GPU-only inference and is
well-supported by high-performance runtimes such as NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM and LMDeploy.^3 GPTQ
(Generalized Post-Training Quantization): GPTQ is another widely adopted PTQ method that focuses on
GPU inference. It employs a layer-wise quantization approach that uses approximate second-order
Hessian information to minimize quantization error, achieving a strong balance between compression and
accuracy.[^gptq] Like AWQ, GPTQ is designed for scenarios where the entire model can reside within GPU
VRAM and is supported by a wide range of GPU hardware and inference backends. QLoRA and FlexGen: It is
important to distinguish between quantization formats and the techniques or engines that use them.
QLoRA is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, not an inference format. It involves
quantizing a base model to 4-bits (using a format called NF4) and then training small, low-rank
adapters on top of it.^6 While highly effective for reducing memory during training, the output is a
set of adapter weights, not a standalone quantized model for deployment. FlexGen is an inference
engine designed for high-throughput generation on severely resource-constrained hardware, such as a
single 16 GB GPU running a 175-billion parameter model.^8 It achieves this through an aggressive
offloading strategy that pages model tensors (weights, activations, and the KV cache) not just to CPU
RAM but also to disk storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs). FlexGen internally uses 4-bit group-wise
quantization to compress these tensors and minimize I/O overhead.^10 While a powerful demonstration of
VRAM optimization, its reliance on disk I/O introduces significant latency, making it unsuitable for
the project's target of ≤800 ms per agent turn. However, it remains a valuable tool for risk
mitigation and non-interactive, batch-processing tasks.

### 1.2 Preserving Intelligence: Mitigating Reasoning Degradation on MMLU & GSM8K

The primary risk of aggressive 4-bit quantization is not a subtle drop in perplexity but a catastrophic degradation of a
model's complex reasoning abilities. This is the single greatest threat to the viability of a
multi-agent system, where agents are often tasked with specialized reasoning. Empirical studies have
quantified this degradation starkly: one analysis reported an average quality drop of 12% across
multiple benchmarks, with performance on the Grade School Math (GSM8K) benchmark plummeting by
28%.[^quant-bench] Another recent study on mathematical reasoning found that quantization can degrade accuracy
by as much as 69.81% on complex benchmarks like MATH and AIME.[^math-bench] An agent that cannot reason is
ineffective, regardless of how efficiently it runs. Recent research has not only identified the
cause of this degradation but has also proposed actionable mitigation strategies. The Root Cause:
Activation Outliers: The performance collapse is not due to a uniform loss of information. Instead,
it is primarily caused by the emergence of extreme outliers in the activation tensors during
inference.^15 These outliers, which can be orders of magnitude larger than typical activation values,
force the quantization algorithm to use a very large scaling factor. This "stretches" the
quantization grid to accommodate the outlier, leaving very few discrete quantization levels for the
vast majority of normal-value activations, resulting in a massive loss of information and
precision.^16 Critically, these outliers are now understood to be a byproduct of standard LLM
pre-training methodologies, particularly the use of adaptive optimizers like Adam and certain
normalization schemes, rather than an inherent property of the Transformer architecture itself.^15
Mitigation Strategy 1: Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP): The most fundamental solution is to prevent
outliers from forming in the first place. The "Outlier-Safe Pre-Training" (OSP) framework proposes a
set of practical guidelines for training quantization-friendly LLMs from scratch.^15 By replacing the
Adam optimizer with alternatives like Muon and using techniques such as Single-Scale RMSNorm, OSP
produces models that are inherently free of activation outliers. An OSP-trained model, when
subjected to aggressive 4-bit quantization, demonstrates dramatically superior performance
preservation compared to a traditionally trained model.^18 This provides a clear directive for model
selection: to maximize post-quantization quality, George should prioritize models that are
explicitly advertised as being trained using OSP or similar quantization-aware techniques.
Mitigation Strategy 2: In-situ Correction with "Silver Bullet" Datasets (InfiJanice): For existing
models that were not trained with OSP and suffer from quantization-induced degradation, a post-hoc
repair mechanism has been developed. The "InfiJanice" methodology involves a three-step process 13:
Identify Failures: The quantized model is run on a reasoning benchmark (e.g., GSM8K), and its
incorrect reasoning traces are collected. Curate "Silver Bullet" Data: An automated pipeline, often
using a more powerful "expert" model, analyzes the failure cases to identify the specific reasoning
steps where errors occur. It then generates correct reasoning paths for these specific problems,
creating a small, highly targeted dataset of "correct/incorrect" preference pairs. Rapid
Fine-Tuning: The degraded, quantized model is then fine-tuned for a very short period (e.g., 3-5
minutes on a single GPU) on this "Silver Bullet" dataset using a technique like Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). This process has been shown to be remarkably effective, restoring the
mathematical reasoning accuracy of a 4-bit model to the level of its full-precision counterpart
without harming its general capabilities. This transforms the problem of poor quantization
performance from an immutable fact into a solvable engineering challenge, providing an actionable
recipe to repair and enhance the chosen agent models.

### 1.3 Recommendation: The Optimal Format for a 4-7B Parameter Swarm on 16GB VRAM

Based on the analysis of the project's core constraints, GGUF is the recommended quantization format for the multi-agent
system. The justification for this choice is not based on a single metric like raw speed but on the
holistic requirements of the system architecture. The primary, non-negotiable constraint is fitting
at least five 7-billion parameter models onto a single 16 GB GPU. A 4-bit quantized 7B model
requires approximately 4.5 GB of VRAM for its weights. Loading five such models would require
5×4.5 GB=22.5 GB, which exceeds the available 16 GB budget, even before accounting for the KV cache,
activations, and framework overhead. This calculation reveals a critical architectural insight: some
form of memory offloading from VRAM to system RAM is not an optional optimization but a fundamental
necessity. The system cannot function without it. This necessity dictates the choice of format and
runtime. While AWQ and GPTQ are highly performant when a model fits entirely in VRAM, their support
for flexible, granular layer-offloading to system RAM is less mature and not a primary design
feature. In contrast, the GGUF format, in conjunction with the llama.cpp inference engine, is built
around this concept. It provides a simple, robust, and widely-supported mechanism (n_gpu_layers
parameter) to precisely control the VRAM/RAM split for each model. This allows for the creation of a
stable, co-resident swarm of agents by allocating a specific VRAM "budget" to each one, ensuring the
total VRAM usage remains under the 16 GB limit. The performance penalty incurred by accessing some
layers from system RAM over the PCIe bus is an acceptable trade-off for achieving the required model
density. Quantization Method (7B Model) Est. VRAM (Weights) Est. Throughput (tok/s) MMLU Score (%

column highlights the architectural relevance of each method.

## Section 2: The Engine Room - Benchmarking and Selecting an Inference Runtime

With GGUF established as the optimal model format for its memory flexibility, the next critical
decision is the choice of inference runtime. The runtime is the software engine that loads the
quantized model, manages the GPU, and executes inference requests. Its efficiency directly impacts
both latency and throughput. This section benchmarks the leading open-source runtimes on the target
RTX 4080 SUPER hardware and provides a recommendation tailored to the specific demands of a
high-density, offloading-heavy multi-agent system.

2.1 Throughput vs. Latency: vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, and LMDeploy on the RTX 4080 SUPER While numerous
inference engines exist, a few stand out for their performance and feature sets on NVIDIA hardware.
TensorRT-LLM: This is NVIDIA's open-source library for high-performance LLM inference, built on top
of the TensorRT deep learning compiler.26 Its primary advantage is raw speed. By compiling a model
into a highly optimized engine specifically for a target GPU architecture (e.g., Ada Lovelace for
the RTX 4080 SUPER), it can achieve significant performance gains. Benchmarks on an RTX 4090 show
TensorRT-LLM can be 30-70% faster than llama.cpp for single-stream throughput.3 This performance
comes at the cost of increased complexity---each model must be explicitly compiled for the target
GPU---and reduced flexibility, as it is tightly coupled to the NVIDIA ecosystem.27 vLLM: Developed
at UC Berkeley, vLLM's key innovation is PagedAttention, a novel memory management algorithm for the
KV cache that dramatically improves throughput for concurrent requests.28 Combined with Continuous
Batching, vLLM excels in high-throughput serving scenarios, often outperforming other frameworks by
a significant margin when serving many simultaneous users to a single model.31 It strikes an
excellent balance between high performance and ease of use, often requiring just a pip install.27
LMDeploy: From the creators of MMRazor, LMDeploy features the TurboMind inference engine, which is
heavily optimized for quantized models. It claims substantial speedups for 4-bit inference,
potentially 2.4x faster than FP16 execution.27 It incorporates advanced features like persistent
batching (another term for continuous batching) and a blocked KV cache, making it a strong
competitor to vLLM, particularly in high-concurrency throughput benchmarks.4 llama.cpp: This
C++-based engine is the canonical runtime for the GGUF format. Its primary strengths are not raw,
single-stream speed but its unparalleled versatility, portability, and, most importantly, its
first-class support for CPU/GPU hybrid execution via layer offloading.1 It is extremely memory
efficient and has a minimal dependency footprint. While benchmarks show it is slower than
specialized engines like TensorRT-LLM, its performance on modern GPUs is still formidable. For
example, a Llama 3 8B Q4_K_M model can achieve over 100 tokens/second on an RTX 4080.23 Other
Runtimes (MLC-LLM, Petals): The landscape includes other notable projects. MLC-LLM is a machine
learning compiler that can deploy LLMs to a wide array of backends, including NVIDIA (CUDA/Vulkan),
AMD, Apple Metal, and even web browsers via WebGPU, prioritizing universality.35 Petals is a unique
engine for running extremely large models (100B+ parameters) by distributing layers across a
peer-to-peer network of consumer GPUs, BitTorrent-style.37 While innovative, these are not directly
applicable to the project's goal of a self-contained, single-GPU system.

2.2 Deep Dive into Core Optimizations The performance of modern inference engines is driven by a
handful of key algorithmic and systems-level optimizations. PagedAttention (vLLM): The KV cache is a
major consumer of VRAM during inference, and its size grows with every generated token. Traditional
systems allocate a contiguous block of memory for each sequence's cache, leading to significant
internal and external fragmentation and wasted memory.38 PagedAttention solves this by borrowing
concepts from operating system virtual memory.29 It partitions the KV cache into fixed-size "blocks"
(analogous to memory pages) that are stored non-contiguously. A "block table" maps logical token
positions to these physical blocks. This approach nearly eliminates memory waste (reducing it to
\<4%), allows for flexible memory sharing between different requests, and dramatically increases the
effective batch size the GPU can handle, boosting throughput by 2-4x.29 Continuous Batching (vLLM,
LMDeploy): In contrast to static batching (where the server waits for a full batch before starting)
or dynamic batching (which uses a timeout), continuous batching operates at the token level.39 The
server processes the entire batch for a single token generation step. As soon as any sequence in the
batch completes, it is evicted, and a new sequence from the waiting queue is immediately added to
the batch for the very next step. This ensures the GPU is always operating at maximum capacity,
eliminating the idle "bubbles" that occur in other batching strategies and maximizing hardware
utilization.28 This is an ideal scheduling strategy for an event-driven system with many
asynchronous agent requests. Speculative Decoding (TensorRT-LLM): This is a latency optimization
technique that is particularly effective for low-batch-size or single-stream inference. It works by
using a small, fast "draft model" to generate a candidate sequence of several tokens (e.g., 4-5
tokens). This cheap speculation is then passed to the large, powerful "target model" for
verification in a single forward pass.40 The target model accepts the draft tokens up to the first
incorrect one. Since a single forward pass of the large model can validate multiple tokens, the
average time per token is significantly reduced.41 This, however, adds the complexity of running and
managing two models simultaneously. CUDA Graphs: Launching CUDA kernels from the CPU incurs a small
but non-trivial overhead. In the token generation (decode) phase of an LLM, the sequence of kernel
launches is identical for every step. CUDA Graphs exploit this by allowing the runtime to "capture"
the entire sequence of operations for one step into a single graph object. This graph can then be
"replayed" in subsequent steps with a single command, dramatically reducing CPU overhead and the
latency between kernel executions.44 This optimization is now implemented in several engines,
including recent versions of llama.cpp.22.3 Recommendation: The Optimal Runtime Configuration for
Multi-Model Serving While frameworks like vLLM and TensorRT-LLM demonstrate superior performance in
scenarios where models fit comfortably within VRAM, the architectural constraints of this project
lead to a different conclusion. The optimal runtime configuration is a hybrid approach centered on
llama.cpp (via its llama-cpp-python server binding) as the core inference server. The rationale is a
direct continuation of the logic from Section 1. The primary challenge is not achieving the absolute
maximum tokens/second for a single model, but rather enabling the stable co-residency of five or
more models within a 16 GB VRAM budget. This makes efficient and controllable memory offloading the
single most critical feature of the inference engine. llama.cpp is designed from the ground up to
support the GGUF format and its CPU/GPU layer-splitting capability. This feature is mature, robust,
and provides the necessary granular control to manage the VRAM budget across multiple,
simultaneously loaded models. While vLLM does have mechanisms for using CPU memory as swap space, it
is less explicit and controllable than llama.cpp's layer-based offloading.45 For this specific
high-density use case, the architectural requirement for offloading outweighs the raw speed benefits
of other engines. The performance of llama.cpp on an RTX 4080 SUPER is more than sufficient to meet
the ≤800 ms latency target for typical agent interactions, which usually involve generating a few
dozen tokens, not thousands. Engine Throughput (tok/s) Latency (ms/tok) VRAM (Model+Cache) Avg.

benchmarks.23 Power is a qualitative estimate. The "Key Feature" column highlights the most relevant
capability for George's specific high-density, VRAM-constrained use case, justifying the selection
of llama.cpp.

## Section 3: The Conductor - Scheduling and Routing for a Multi-Agent Collective

Having established the foundational components---GGUF models executed by a llama.cpp server---this
section addresses the system-level orchestration. A successful multi-agent system requires more than
just efficient models; it needs an intelligent conductor to manage workloads, route tasks, and
handle the complexities of shared resource management. Here, we design the scheduling and routing
logic that will transform the collection of individual models into a cohesive, intelligent swarm.
3.1 The Cost of Cognition: Quantifying and Mitigating GPU Context-Switching Overhead A naive
approach to managing multiple models on one GPU might be to load each agent's model into VRAM only
when it's needed---a "load-on-demand" strategy. This approach is fundamentally non-viable due to the
prohibitive cost of GPU context switching. Unlike CPU context switching, which is a highly
optimized, microsecond-level operation, swapping gigabytes of model data in and out of GPU VRAM is a
heavyweight process dominated by PCIe bus transfer speeds.47 For a 4.5 GB quantized model on a PCIe
4.0 x16 bus with a theoretical maximum bandwidth of \~32 GB/s, the transfer time alone would be in
the hundreds of milliseconds, even before accounting for kernel launch overhead and memory
allocation. Real-world experiments show that snapshot-loading a 13B model can take 2-5 seconds.48
Research into pipelined context switching for deep learning models confirms that the overhead of
transmitting model parameters is a significant performance bottleneck.49 The recent Prism multi-LLM
serving system, which does employ model swapping for idle models, is designed for data center
environments with different SLOs and still highlights the challenge of model activation latency.50
For a system with a strict latency budget of ≤800 ms per agent turn, a multi-second loading delay
for each turn is an immediate violation. This leads to a critical design principle: the system must
avoid VRAM swapping of model weights at all costs during active operation. The only viable strategy
is to ensure all active agent models are co-resident, with their layers pre-allocated between VRAM
and system RAM at startup. The scheduler's role is therefore not to manage the physical loading of
models, but to manage the logical flow of requests to these already-loaded models.

3.2 Architecting the Router: Implementing "Cheapest Competent Model" Selection With multiple
specialized agents co-resident, the system needs a mechanism to route incoming tasks to the correct
agent. This routing decision is itself a complex task that can be handled by an LLM. The goal is to
implement a "cheapest competent model" strategy: use the most resource-efficient model capable of
making the routing decision, thereby preserving the computational power of the larger, specialized
models for the tasks they are designed for. A comparison of agentic frameworks reveals the best tool
for this purpose: CrewAI: A high-level framework that excels at orchestrating agents with predefined
roles in a structured, often sequential, process.51 While it can connect to local models 54, its
abstractions are less suited for building the kind of complex, conditional, low-level routing logic
required here.56 DSPy: A powerful framework for programming with LLMs, focusing on algorithmic
optimization of prompts and model parameters.57 It is not an agent orchestration framework. However,
its ability to define and optimize modules with swappable LMs makes it an excellent tool for
building the components of the router---for example, creating a highly optimized classification
module that forms the core of the routing logic.59 LangGraph: This framework is the ideal choice for
implementing the router. It represents workflows as explicit, stateful graphs where nodes are agents
or tools and edges represent conditional logic.52 This provides the necessary low-level control to
build a sophisticated, dynamic routing system. Its concepts of a "Supervisor" node and "Conditional
Edges" are perfectly suited for implementing the desired architecture.51 The recommended router
implementation strategy using LangGraph is as follows: The Supervisor Pattern: The entire workflow
will be encapsulated in a LangGraph StateGraph. A central "supervisor" node will serve as the entry
point for all incoming tasks.62 The Router LLM: The supervisor node will be powered by a very small
and fast "router" LLM (e.g., a highly quantized 3B model like Phi-3-mini). Its sole purpose is to
analyze the incoming task and output a classification indicating which specialized agent should
handle it (e.g., {"next_agent": "code_generator"}). This embodies the "cheapest competent model"
principle by offloading the high-frequency, low-complexity routing task to an efficient model.
Conditional Edges: The supervisor node will be connected to all the specialized agent nodes via a
conditional edge. This edge will execute a Python function that reads the next_agent field from the
supervisor's output and directs the graph's execution flow to the corresponding agent node.66 Each
agent node is a simple function that formats a request and calls its designated model endpoint on
the llama.cpp server.

3.3 Blueprint: A NATS-Integrated, Event-Driven Agent Scheduler The LangGraph router will be
integrated into George's existing NATS-based, event-driven architecture. This ensures a decoupled,
scalable system. Sequence of Operations: Task Ingestion: An external process publishes a task
message to a NATS topic, e.g., tasks.new. The message payload contains the user prompt and any
relevant metadata. Scheduler Service: A dedicated Python service subscribes to the tasks.new topic.
Upon receiving a message, it instantiates and invokes the LangGraph router with the task payload as
the initial state. Routing: The LangGraph supervisor node is executed. It calls the small router LLM
to determine the appropriate destination agent. Conditional Handoff: The graph's conditional edge
fires, routing the state to the selected agent node (e.g., code_agent). Inference Request: The
code_agent node's function executes. It constructs an OpenAI-compatible API request and sends it to
the llama.cpp server endpoint, specifying the particular model file it requires (e.g.,
codellama-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf). Inference Execution: The llama.cpp server, which has all models
pre-loaded with their respective VRAM/RAM layer splits, processes the request on the specified model
and returns the result. Result Publication: The agent node receives the response, updates the
graph's final state, and the graph execution concludes. The scheduler service then publishes the
final result to an output topic, e.g., results.completed. Pseudocode for the LangGraph Router:

```python
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Literal
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage

# 1. Define the shared state for the graph
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated, add_messages]
    next_agent: str

# 2. Define the LLM clients (pointing to the llama.cpp server)
router_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="phi-3-mini.Q4_K_M.gguf",...)
coder_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="codellama-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf",...)
writer_llm = ChatOpenAI(model="mistral-7b-instruct.Q4_K_M.gguf",...)

# 3. Define the supervisor node (the router)
def supervisor_node(state: AgentState):
    # Use the small router_llm to decide the next step
    response = router_llm.invoke(state['messages'])
    return {"next_agent": response.content} # e.g., "coder" or "writer"

# 4. Define the worker agent nodes
def coder_node(state: AgentState):
    response = coder_llm.invoke(state['messages'])
    return {"messages": [response]}

def writer_node(state: AgentState):
    response = writer_llm.invoke(state['messages'])
    return {"messages": [response]}

# 5. Define the conditional routing logic
def router_edge(state: AgentState) -> Literal["coder", "writer", "__end__"]:
    if state["next_agent"] == "coder":
        return "coder"
    elif state["next_agent"] == "writer":
        return "writer"
    else:
        return END

# 6. Construct the graph
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("supervisor", supervisor_node)
workflow.add_node("coder", coder_node)
workflow.add_node("writer", writer_node)

workflow.add_edge(START, "supervisor")
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "supervisor",
    router_edge,
    {"coder": "coder", "writer": "writer", "__end__": END}
)
workflow.add_edge("coder", END)
workflow.add_edge("writer", END)

# 7. Compile the graph
app = workflow.compile()

# The NATS subscriber would then call app.invoke(...)
```

## Section 4: The Power Profile - Achieving Sub-220W Operation

Meeting the stringent average power draw target of ≤220 W for the GPU requires moving beyond default
hardware settings and implementing a deliberate power management strategy. For a high-end card like
the RTX 4080 SUPER, which has a Total Graphics Power (TGP) of 320W, this represents a significant
reduction. This section provides a practical methodology for hardware tuning, efficiency
measurement, and active power management to operate the agent swarm within this power budget. 4.1
Hardware Tuning: A Practical Guide to Undervolting the RTX 4080 SUPER for AI Workloads

The single most effective technique for reducing GPU power consumption is undervolting. GPUs are
typically shipped with a conservative voltage-frequency curve designed to ensure stability across a
wide range of silicon quality. However, most individual chips can operate at the same clock speeds
using significantly less voltage, which quadratically reduces power consumption (P∝V2). This process
yields substantial reductions in power draw and heat output with minimal, and often zero, impact on
performance.68 Tooling: The recommended tool for this process is MSI Afterburner, a widely used
utility for GPU overclocking, monitoring, and tuning.70 Step-by-Step Undervolting Process: Establish
a Baseline: Before making any changes, run the multi-agent benchmark and use monitoring tools to
record the stock performance, clock speed, voltage, and power draw. Open the Curve Editor: In MSI
Afterburner, press Ctrl+F to open the Voltage/Frequency curve editor. This graph plots the GPU's
core clock frequency (Y-axis) against its operating voltage (X-axis).69 Select a Target Point: Based
on community testing for the RTX 4080 SUPER, a good starting point for an efficiency-focused
undervolt is around 900-950mV.68 Select the point on the curve corresponding to your target voltage
(e.g., 925mV). Set the Clock Speed: Drag this single point vertically to set the desired clock
speed. A good starting point is to aim for a clock speed slightly below the stock boost clock
observed in the baseline test (e.g., 2580 MHz at 925mV).68 Flatten the Curve: After setting the
target point, press L to lock the voltage at that point. This creates a flat line on the curve
editor, ensuring the GPU never exceeds the target voltage, regardless of load. Click the "Apply"
checkmark in the main Afterburner window. Memory Overclock: The GDDR6X memory on the RTX 4080 SUPER
is often underclocked from the factory.68 A moderate memory overclock (e.g., +500 to +1300 MHz in
Afterburner) can reclaim some of the performance lost from the core undervolt and is considered a
"free" performance boost. This should be tested for stability independently. Stability Testing for
AI Workloads: It is crucial to understand that an undervolt stable for gaming may not be stable for
AI inference. Gaming workloads heavily stress the CUDA cores and 3D rendering pipeline. In contrast,
LLM inference places a sustained, heavy load on the Tensor Cores and the memory subsystem. Some
users report that undervolts which pass gaming stress tests can crash when features that utilize
Tensor Cores are activated.68 Therefore, the ultimate stability test must be running the actual
5-agent workload for several hours to ensure the system is robust under its specific operational
load.

4.2 Measuring Efficiency: Profiling Watt-Hours per Million Tokens with pyNVML

To empirically validate the effectiveness of undervolting and other power management strategies, a
precise measurement methodology is required. The pyNVML Library: The nvidia-ml-py library provides
Python bindings for the NVIDIA Management Library (NVML), which is the C API that underpins the
nvidia-smi command-line tool.72 This allows for programmatic access to a rich set of GPU metrics,
including real-time power consumption. Energy Profiling Notebook (Deliverable D4): A Jupyter
notebook will be provided to automate the measurement process. The core of this notebook is a Python
script that performs the following actions: Initialization: Imports the pynvml library and
initializes it with nvmlInit(). It then gets a handle to the GPU device (e.g., device index 0).
Monitoring Thread: It launches a background thread that enters a loop. Inside the loop, it calls
nvmlDeviceGetPowerUsage(handle) at a fixed interval (e.g., every 1 second). This function returns
the current power draw in milliwatts.72 Data Logging: Each power reading is converted to Watts and
logged to a list along with a timestamp. Calculation and Visualization: When the main workload (the
multi-agent benchmark) finishes, the monitoring thread is stopped. The script then uses the logged
power data to: Calculate the average power draw over the entire run. Integrate the power readings
over time to compute the total energy consumed in Watt-seconds, which is then converted to
Watt-hours. Calculate the final efficiency metric: Watt-hours per 1 Million Tokens Generated, by
dividing the total energy by the total number of tokens produced by the benchmark. Use matplotlib to
generate a plot of power consumption over time, allowing for visual analysis of the power profile.

4.3 Active Power Management Strategies

Beyond static hardware tuning, the system's software can also contribute to power efficiency. Idle
State Management: When the NATS message bus is quiet and no agents are processing tasks, the GPU
should automatically enter a low-power idle state (P-State P8). Modern NVIDIA drivers manage this
transition effectively. The energy profiling notebook can be used to verify that the GPU's idle
power draw drops to a low level (typically 15-30W) during periods of inactivity. Consolidating
Inference via Batching: The llama.cpp server supports batching requests. If multiple agent tasks
arrive on the NATS bus within a short time window (e.g., 100ms), the scheduler service can be
designed to group these requests and send them to the llama.cpp server as a single batch. Processing
a batch of requests is more power-efficient than processing them sequentially, as it allows the GPU
to reach a high-utilization state and complete the work more quickly, returning to idle sooner. This
increases the overall computational density and reduces the total time spent in high-power states.

minimal performance loss, resulting in the best energy efficiency.

## Section 5: The Integrated Stack - A Reproducible Build Recipe

This section consolidates the preceding analysis into a concrete, deployable system. It provides the
architectural blueprint and the necessary configuration files to replicate the entire multi-agent
runtime environment, ensuring a seamless setup process from a fresh operating system installation.
5.1 System Architecture Diagram The integrated system is composed of several loosely coupled
services communicating via a central message bus. The architecture is designed for modularity and
resilience. (A diagram would be included here, illustrating the following flow): NATS Message Bus:
The central nervous system of the architecture. External clients publish tasks to topics like
tasks.new. Agent Supervisor Service: A Python application that subscribes to task topics. It
contains the LangGraph router, which uses a small "router" LLM to classify tasks. llama.cpp Server:
A dedicated inference server that exposes an OpenAI-compatible API. It is configured at startup to
load all five (or more) specialized agent models in GGUF format, with layer offloading
(n_gpu_layers) set for each to manage the VRAM budget. GPU (RTX 4080 SUPER): The hardware executing
the inference. A portion of its VRAM holds the GPU layers of all co-resident models. CPU/System RAM:
The CPU runs the NATS server and the Agent Supervisor. System RAM holds the offloaded layers of the
GGUF models. Monitoring Service: A separate process running the Python/pyNVML script to log GPU
power, temperature, and utilization metrics to a CSV file for analysis. This event-driven,
service-oriented architecture ensures that components can be developed, deployed, and scaled
independently. 5.2 The Docker Compose Configuration (Deliverable D2) To ensure maximum
reproducibility and eliminate dependency conflicts, the entire stack is defined within a
docker-compose.yml file. This allows the complete environment to be instantiated with a single
docker compose up command. \# docker-compose.yml configuration

```

Configuration Walkthrough: nats service: A standard NATS server with JetStream persistence enabled
for reliable messaging. inference service: This is the core llama.cpp server. The Dockerfile in
llama_cpp_docker is responsible for compiling llama.cpp with the correct CUDA flags. It mounts a
local ./models directory, where George will place his GGUF files. The command pre-loads the small
router model fully into VRAM for fast routing decisions. Other, larger models are loaded by the
server as needed when the supervisor makes an API call specifying a different model path. The
llama-cpp-python server intelligently caches models in memory according to their usage. supervisor
service: This container runs the Python application containing the LangGraph router. It connects to
the NATS server to receive tasks and to the inference service to make LLM calls. Environment
variables are used to configure the endpoints and model names, decoupling the logic from the
infrastructure. monitoring service: This service runs the energy profiling script (Deliverable D4),
logging power data to a mounted volume for easy access and analysis on the host machine. 5.3
Verification: A Guide to Running the Benchmark Suite To validate that the deployed stack meets all
performance and efficiency targets, a verification script and procedure are provided. Prerequisites:
Ensure Docker is installed with NVIDIA container runtime support, and the ./models directory is
populated with the required GGUF model files. Launch the Stack: From the project's root directory,
run docker compose up -d. This will build the images and start all services in the background. Run
the Benchmark: A benchmark.py script will be provided. This script connects to the NATS server and
simulates a concurrent 5-agent workload by publishing 100 task messages to the tasks.new topic at a
controlled rate. It will also subscribe to the results.completed topic to measure the end-to-end
latency for each task. Monitor and Collect Data: While the benchmark is running, execute the
monitoring service: docker compose run --rm monitoring. This will start the power profiling script,
which will run for a specified duration (e.g., 10 minutes) and save the results to
./reports/power_profile.csv. Simultaneously, use watch nvidia-smi on the host machine to observe the
VRAM usage. Analyze Results: Latency: The benchmark.py script will output the average, P95, and P99
end-to-end latency. Verify this is ≤800 ms. VRAM: The nvidia-smi output should show that total VRAM
usage remains consistently below the 16 GB limit. Power: Analyze the generated power_profile.csv
using the provided Jupyter notebook (D4). Verify that the average power draw is ≤220 W. This
comprehensive verification process provides empirical proof that the system design and configuration
successfully meet all of George's specified success criteria.

## Section 6: Future-Proofing and Contingency Planning

A robust system is not only performant on day one but is also designed for extensibility and
resilience. This final section provides guidance on expanding the agent swarm with new modalities,
analyzes future hardware bottlenecks, and outlines a clear plan for mitigating common failure modes.
6.1 Extending the Swarm: Integrating Lightweight Vision and Audio Models The LangGraph-based router
architecture is inherently extensible. Adding new capabilities, such as vision or audio processing,
is a matter of defining new agent nodes and updating the router's logic. Audio Transcription: To add
an audio processing agent, whisper.cpp is the ideal choice. It is built upon the same ggml tensor
library as llama.cpp, ensuring high performance and efficiency on both CPU and GPU.2 A new
"transcription" agent node can be created in LangGraph. This node would take an audio file path as
input, invoke a whisper.cpp process or library call to perform transcription, and return the
resulting text. The supervisor's router LLM would be fine-tuned or prompted to recognize tasks like
"transcribe this meeting" and route them to this new node. Vision-Language Processing: For image
understanding, a lightweight Vision-Language Model (VLM) can be integrated. Models like VILA or
Llava are available in GGUF format and can be served by llama.cpp. A new "vision" agent node would
be added to the graph. The supervisor would route tasks containing image inputs (e.g., "describe
this image") to the vision agent, which would then call the llama.cpp server with the appropriate
VLM model specified. Managing the additional VRAM for the VLM would require careful adjustment of
the n_gpu_layers for all co-resident models to stay within the 16 GB budget. 6.2 Bottleneck
Analysis: PCIe 5.0 vs. System RAM for Next-Gen Workloads The recommended architecture relies heavily
on offloading model layers to system RAM. In this configuration, the primary performance bottleneck
for the offloaded portion of the model is not the speed of the CPU or the RAM itself, but the
bandwidth of the Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) bus that connects the CPU/RAM to
the GPU. The RTX 4080 SUPER uses a PCIe 4.0 x16 interface, which has a theoretical maximum bandwidth
of approximately 32 GB/s. When an agent invokes a model and requires a layer that resides in system
RAM, that layer's weights must be transferred over the PCIe bus to the GPU for computation. This
transfer latency is the dominant cost for offloaded layers. Future motherboard and CPU platforms
supporting PCIe 5.0 will double this bandwidth to \~64 GB/s. For this specific offloading-heavy
architecture, an upgrade to a PCIe 5.0 compatible system would yield a near-linear performance
improvement for the offloaded layers. This would directly reduce the latency of each agent turn, or
alternatively, allow for more layers to be offloaded to RAM while maintaining the same latency
budget, thereby freeing up VRAM to accommodate even more agents or larger models. 6.3 Risk &
Mitigation Brief (Deliverable D5) A 24/7 autonomous system must be designed to anticipate and handle
failures gracefully. Failure Mode: Out of Memory (OOM) Errors Cause: The combined VRAM requirements
of model weights (GPU layers), the KV cache for all active requests, and framework overhead exceed
the 16 GB capacity. This can happen if the context length of requests grows unexpectedly large or if
too many agents are processing requests simultaneously. Mitigation Strategy: Proactive: Carefully
tune the n_gpu_layers for each model in the llama.cpp server configuration at startup to leave a
generous headroom (e.g., 2-3 GB) for the dynamic KV cache. Reactive: If OOM errors still occur, the
primary response is to further reduce the n_gpu_layers for one or more of the larger models,
offloading more to system RAM. Advanced (Non-interactive tasks): For background tasks that are not
latency-sensitive, the system can be configured to use an engine like FlexGen.8 The LangGraph router
could identify these tasks and route them to a separate FlexGen instance that offloads entirely to
CPU/disk, preserving precious VRAM for the interactive agents. Failure Mode: Thermal Throttling
Cause: Sustained 24/7 inference, even with an efficient undervolt, can lead to heat buildup within
the PC case if airflow is inadequate. This will cause the GPU to automatically reduce its clock
speeds to protect itself, leading to increased latency and degraded performance. Mitigation
Strategy: Monitoring: The pyNVML monitoring script (D4) should be configured to log GPU temperature
(nvmlDeviceGetTemperature) alongside power draw. Set up alerts if the temperature consistently
exceeds a safe threshold (e.g., 80°C). Hardware: Ensure the workstation has excellent case airflow
with a proper intake/exhaust fan configuration. Tuning: Use MSI Afterburner to set a more aggressive
custom fan curve that increases fan speed earlier as temperatures rise, preventing the GPU from
reaching its throttle point. Failure Mode: Driver Bugs / CUDA Incompatibilities Cause: A mismatch
between the NVIDIA driver version, the CUDA toolkit version used to compile llama.cpp, the PyTorch
version, and other dependencies. This is a common source of instability and difficult-to-debug
errors. Mitigation Strategy: Containerization: This risk is almost entirely mitigated by using the
provided Docker Compose environment (D2). The Dockerfile for each service locks in a specific,
known-good version of the base image, CUDA toolkit, Python libraries, and compilation flags. This
creates a hermetic, reproducible environment that is insulated from the host system's configuration.
Failure Mode: Agent Hallucination / Degraded Reasoning Performance Cause: A 4-bit quantized model,
even if generally capable, may fail on a specific, complex reasoning task, providing an incorrect or
nonsensical answer. Mitigation Strategy: Post-Hoc Repair: If a particular agent model is found to be
consistently underperforming on its specialized task, apply the "InfiJanice" methodology described
in Section 1.2.13 Create a "Silver Bullet" dataset from its failures and perform a quick fine-tuning
run to restore its reasoning capabilities. Hierarchical Fallback: The LangGraph supervisor can be
programmed with a fallback mechanism. If an agent's output fails a validation check (e.g., the code
it generated doesn't compile, or its summary is flagged as nonsensical by another model), the
supervisor can re-route the original task to a more powerful, but more resource-intensive, model
(e.g., a larger model with more layers on the GPU) or flag the task for human review. This creates a
resilient, self-correcting loop.
