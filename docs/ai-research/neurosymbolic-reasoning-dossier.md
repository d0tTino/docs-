# The Neuro-Symbolic Landscape: A Unified Taxonomy

## Introduction: The Need for a Hybrid Paradigm

The history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been characterized by a fundamental dichotomy between two dominant paradigms: symbolic AI and sub-symbolic, or connectionist, AI. Symbolic AI, often termed "Good Old-Fashioned AI" (GOFAI), operates on explicitly defined symbols and rules. Grounded in formal languages like predicate logic, its strengths lie in interpretability, strong generalization within well-defined domains, and the capacity for formal reasoning, making it effective for tasks in mathematics or legal systems. However, its brittleness in the face of noisy, ambiguous, or unstructured data has historically limited its applicability. Conversely, the connectionist approach, epitomized by modern deep learning, utilizes neural networks to learn representations directly from large datasets. This paradigm excels at handling high-dimensional, unstructured data (e.g., images, audio, text) and has driven breakthroughs in perception-heavy tasks like computer vision and natural language processing (NLP).^1 Yet, its primary weaknesses are its operational opacity—often functioning as a "black box"—and its profound dependence on vast quantities of labeled data.^1
The emerging field of Neuro-Symbolic (NeSy) AI posits that the path toward more robust, generalizable, and trustworthy intelligence lies not in the supremacy of one paradigm but in their principled synthesis.^4 NeSy AI aims to build systems that can learn from data while simultaneously reasoning over abstract concepts and rules, effectively merging the strengths of both approaches.^1 This integration is not merely a technical convenience but a reflection of a deeper cognitive model. The architecture of human cognition, as described in Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory, involves two distinct modes of thought: a "System 1" that is fast, intuitive, and reflexive (analogous to neural pattern recognition) and a "System 2" that is slow, step-by-step, and deliberative (analogous to symbolic reasoning).^6 NeSy systems seek to create an artificial cognitive architecture that mirrors this powerful duality, enabling AI that can both perceive and reason. The recent maturation of the field, marked by a push towards formalization and principled design, underscores the necessity of a structured framework for understanding and developing these hybrid systems.10

## Kautz's Taxonomy: A Practical Framework for NeSy Architectures

To navigate the diverse landscape of NeSy integration strategies, the taxonomy proposed by Henry Kautz provides an invaluable conceptual map.^5 It categorizes systems based on the nature of the interaction between their neural and symbolic components, moving from loose coupling to deep integration.

### Type 1: symbolic Neuro symbolic

This represents the standard operational model for much of modern deep learning, particularly in NLP. Symbolic inputs, such as words or text tokens, are converted into continuous vector representations (embeddings). These vectors are then processed by a large neural network, which outputs another vector that is subsequently decoded back into a symbolic form.^6 Models like BERT and GPT-3 fall into this category. While technically a bridge between symbolic and sub-symbolic worlds, it is often considered a baseline rather than a "true" NeSy integration, as the core processing is entirely neural.12

### Type 2: Symbolic[Neuro]

In this architecture, a symbolic system maintains primary control and invokes a neural network as a specialized subroutine to handle tasks that are difficult to formalize symbolically.^9 The canonical example is AlphaGo, where the high-level Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm—a symbolic planner—calls upon a deep neural network to perform a heuristic evaluation of game positions, a task at which neural networks excel.6

### Type 3: Neuro | Symbolic

This category describes a pipeline or co-routine architecture where neural and symbolic components are peers, each handling a complementary task.^5 Typically, the neural component acts as a perception front-end, converting unstructured data (e.g., pixels in an image) into a discrete, symbolic representation (e.g., a list of recognized objects and their spatial relationships). This symbolic output is then fed into a separate symbolic reasoning engine for further processing, planning, or inference.^13 The LLM-driven pipeline with a symbolic guardrail, which is the central focus of this dossier, is a prime example of a Type 3 system.

### Type 4: Neuro:Symbolic → Neuro

Here, symbolic knowledge is used to improve or guide the training of a neural network. This can be achieved in several ways: by using symbolic rules to generate large amounts of labeled training data, by incorporating logical constraints directly into the model's loss function as a regularization term, or by using symbolic knowledge to shape the network's architecture.^7 The symbolic knowledge is effectively "compiled" away during the training process, resulting in a purely neural model at inference time that has been imbued with logical constraints.

### Type 5: Neuro\_{Symbolic}

This represents one of the tightest forms of integration, where logical rules are directly encoded into the structure and weights of a neural network.^9 The network's architecture is a direct reflection of the symbolic knowledge base. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs), which encode first-order logic formulas as differentiable operations on tensors, and the Logical Boltzmann Machines (LBMs) discussed in this dossier are exemplars of this approach.6

### Type 6: Neuro

The inverse of Type 2, this architecture features a neural model as the primary controller, which has the ability to call an external symbolic reasoning engine as a tool or subroutine.^6 This pattern has gained significant prominence with the advent of LLM-powered agents and plugins. A clear example is an LLM like ChatGPT invoking a query to a computational engine like Wolfram Alpha to solve a mathematical problem, thereby offloading a task that requires formal, precise reasoning to a specialized symbolic tool.6

## A Formal Foundation: Neurosymbolic Inference as Integration

The proliferation of architectures described by Kautz's taxonomy highlights the field's dynamism but also a fragmentation that can make principled comparison difficult.^14 Recent theoretical work aims to establish a more unified foundation. A groundbreaking proposal by De Smet & De Raedt (2025) introduces a formal definition of neurosymbolic AI that abstracts its key ingredients.^10 This framework posits that neurosymbolic inference can be universally defined as the computation of an integral over the product of a logical function and a belief function.
Formally, given a logical language L, a set of possible interpretations (worlds) Ω, a formula ϕ∈L, and an interpretation ω∈Ω, we can define two key components:
A logical function, μ(ϕ,ω), which evaluates the semantic value of the formula ϕ in the world ω. For crisp logic, this would be 1 if ω satisfies ϕ and 0 otherwise.
A belief function, bθ​(ϕ,ω), which is a parameterized function (typically a neural network with weights θ) that assigns a degree of belief, or weight, to the interpretation ω satisfying the formula ϕ.
Neurosymbolic inference is then defined as the computation of the following functional:
Inference(ϕ)=∫ω∈Ω​μ(ϕ,ω)⋅bθ​(ϕ,ω)dω
This elegant formulation provides a powerful lens for analysis. It suggests that the diverse array of NeSy systems are, at their core, different instantiations of the logical function μ and the belief function bθ​, and employ different techniques to compute or approximate this integral. This moves the field from a collection of distinct architectural patterns toward a more unified, mathematical discipline, providing a pathway for the principled design and comparison of future NeSy systems.

## Energy-Based Neuro-Symbolic Systems: Logic Boltzmann Machines (LBMs)

### Foundations: Energy-Based Models and Boltzmann Machines

Energy-Based Models (EBMs) represent a powerful and elegant class of generative models that learn by associating a scalar energy value with every possible configuration of the variables they model.^4 The core principle, inspired by statistical physics, is that more plausible or compatible configurations are assigned lower energy, while less plausible ones are assigned higher energy.^21 This energy landscape is then related to a probability distribution via the Boltzmann distribution.^22 p(x)=Ze−E(x)/T​where E(x) is the energy of a configuration x, T is a temperature parameter, and Z=∑x′​e−E(x′)/T is the partition function, a normalization constant that sums over all possible configurations.^23 The model learns by shaping its energy function such that the observed data points correspond to low-energy valleys.
A Boltzmann Machine (BM) is a specific type of EBM realized as a stochastic, recurrent neural network with binary units (neurons).^22 In its general form, every unit is connected to every other unit, creating a densely interconnected network. These units are typically divided into 'visible' units, which represent the data, and 'hidden' units, which learn to capture higher-order correlations and dependencies within the data.^22 However, this full connectivity makes training and inference computationally intractable because calculating the partition function Z requires an exponential sum over all 2N possible states of the network, where N is the number of units.^22
This intractability led to the development of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), a simplified variant that has become the workhorse of many energy-based approaches.^23 An RBM has a bipartite graph structure: it consists of one layer of visible units and one layer of hidden units, but with a crucial restriction—there are no connections between units within the same layer.^25 This constraint makes the units within a layer conditionally independent given the states of the other layer, which dramatically simplifies the computations required for inference and learning. The energy function for a binary RBM is defined as:
E(v,h)=−aTv−bTh−vTWh
where v and h are the state vectors of the visible and hidden units, a and b are their respective bias vectors, and W is the matrix of weights connecting the two layers.27

### The Core Mechanism: Encoding Logic as Energy

The central innovation of Logical Boltzmann Machines (LBMs) is to leverage the RBM architecture not for learning data distributions, but for representing and reasoning with propositional logic.^17 The objective is to construct an RBM such that there is a direct equivalence between the logical satisfiability of a given formula ϕ and the energy landscape of the machine. Specifically, a truth assignment to the propositional variables should satisfy ϕ if and only if the corresponding state of the visible units is a global minimum of the RBM's energy function.17
To achieve this unambiguous mapping, the logical formula must first be converted into a specific canonical form: Strict Disjunctive Normal Form (SDNF). A formula in Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) is a disjunction (OR) of one or more conjunctive clauses, where each clause is a conjunction (AND) of literals (variables or their negations).^29 A DNF is considered strict if, for any possible truth assignment to the variables, at most one of its conjunctive clauses evaluates to true.^28 This "one-hot" property is critical; it ensures that each satisfying assignment activates a unique hidden unit in the corresponding RBM, preventing interference between clauses and creating a clean energy landscape. Any propositional formula can be systematically converted to an equivalent SDNF.
Once a formula is in SDNF, it can be deterministically translated into an RBM architecture using the following algorithm 28:
Visible Units: For each propositional variable xi​ in the logical formula, a corresponding binary visible unit vi​ is created in the RBM. The state of vi​ (0 or 1) will represent the truth value (False or True) of xi​.
Hidden Units: For each conjunctive clause Cj​ in the SDNF formula, a corresponding binary hidden unit hj​ is created. This unit will act as a detector for its specific clause.
Weights and Biases: The parameters of the RBM (W, a, b) are not learned from data but are set analytically based on the structure of the SDNF formula. The goal is to craft an energy function where a hidden unit hj​ is strongly activated (contributing a large negative energy term) only when its corresponding clause Cj​ is satisfied by the current state of the visible units. This is achieved by setting the weights and biases according to precise rules, effectively "compiling" the logical knowledge into the network's parameters.

### Reasoning as Energy Minimization

With the logical formula compiled into the LBM's structure, the task of logical reasoning—specifically, finding a satisfying assignment (a model of the formula)—is transformed into the task of finding a global minimum in the machine's energy landscape.^17 The states of the visible units that correspond to these minimum-energy configurations are precisely the truth assignments that satisfy the original logical formula.
This energy minimization can be performed using standard RBM inference algorithms like Gibbs sampling.^17 Gibbs sampling is an iterative process where the state of each unit is repeatedly sampled from its conditional probability distribution, given the states of the other units. Because of the RBM's structure, this process is efficient and, over time, the network's state distribution converges to the Boltzmann distribution, meaning it will preferentially occupy low-energy states.^22 By running Gibbs sampling on the LBM, one can efficiently sample from the set of all satisfying assignments for the encoded logical formula. This transforms a discrete, combinatorial search problem (Satisfiability or SAT) into a continuous optimization problem that is amenable to massively parallel computation, a key advantage of connectionist systems.^17 This "compiled" nature makes LBMs exceptionally well-suited for applications requiring repeated, high-speed validation against a fixed set of logical constraints, such as the LLM guardrail system developed in this dossier.

## Probabilistic Logic Programming: The DeepProbLog Paradigm

### Foundations: From Logic to Probabilistic Logic

Standard logic programming, exemplified by languages like Prolog, provides a powerful framework for symbolic reasoning based on facts and rules.^16 However, it operates in a deterministic world, where facts are either true or false. Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) extends this framework to handle uncertainty by allowing facts to be annotated with probabilities.^31 The dominant approach in PLP is the distribution semantics, which partitions a program into two components: a set of independent probabilistic facts and a standard logic program that can use these facts.^31 This defines a probability distribution over the set of all possible deterministic logic programs (or "worlds"), where the probability of a world is the product of the probabilities of the facts that are true within it.
ProbLog is a prominent PLP language that operationalizes these concepts.^16 In ProbLog, a fact f can be declared as probabilistic with the syntax p::f, meaning f is true with probability p. The language's inference engine can then compute the probability of any query being true by summing the probabilities of all the worlds in which that query can be proven. This provides a formal and expressive way to combine logical deduction with probabilistic inference.

### The DeepProbLog Architecture: Integrating Neural Networks

DeepProbLog is a landmark NeSy framework that extends ProbLog by seamlessly integrating deep learning models into the probabilistic logic programming paradigm.^16 This integration is achieved through a single, powerful abstraction: the neural predicate.
A neural predicate is a special type of probabilistic fact whose probabilities are not fixed but are instead determined dynamically by the output of a neural network.^32 The syntax for a neural predicate is an annotated disjunction of the form:
nn(mq​,t)::q(t,u1​);…;q(t,un​)←b1​,…,bm​.
This statement is interpreted as follows: given an input term t, the neural network identified by m_q is executed. The network produces a probability distribution (e.g., via a softmax layer) over a set of possible outcomes {u1​,…,un​}. The probability of the atom q(t,ui​) being true is then set to the i-th value in the network's output distribution.^16 The network m_q is an external, often pre-trained, deep learning model, such as a PyTorch-based convolutional neural network (CNN).
The canonical example used to illustrate DeepProbLog's power is the task of adding numbers represented by MNIST images.^16 A purely neural approach would struggle to learn the abstract rules of addition and generalize. In DeepProbLog, this knowledge is encoded explicitly in a simple logic program:

```Prolog
addition(ImageX, ImageY, Sum) :-
    digit(ImageX, NumX),
    digit(ImageY, NumY),
    Sum is NumX + NumY.

```

Here, digit(Image, Number) is a neural predicate. The digit predicate is backed by a CNN that takes an MNIST image and outputs a probability distribution over the integers 0 through 9. The logic program can then use these probabilistic outputs from the neural perception module to reason about their sum, effectively combining sub-symbolic perception with symbolic arithmetic.

### End-to-End Learning and Inference

The true power of DeepProbLog lies in its ability to be trained end-to-end. The inference process elegantly merges the two worlds: when the logical reasoner encounters a neural predicate during its proof search, it calls the corresponding neural network to obtain the necessary probabilities. It then continues its logical deduction, ultimately compiling the proof structure into a circuit (such as a Sentential Decision Diagram) to efficiently compute the final probability of the query.16
The key mechanism enabling end-to-end learning is the use of an advanced algebraic structure known as a gradient semiring.^16 By redefining the algebraic operations used during the probability calculation, the DeepProbLog inference engine can not only compute the success probability of a query but also simultaneously compute the partial derivative of this probability with respect to each of the input probabilities from the neural predicates.
This gradient information is then propagated backward from the symbolic logic engine into the underlying neural networks. This allows the weights of the neural networks to be updated using standard gradient-descent-based optimization, just as if they were part of a conventional deep learning pipeline.^16 This remarkable capability allows the system to learn complex perception tasks (e.g., how to recognize digits) guided by a high-level, symbolic, and logical objective (e.g., getting the sum correct). This dynamic, modular architecture, where logic acts as a differentiable program orchestrating calls to neural components, stands in stark contrast to the static, compiled approach of LBMs. It is ideal for problems where the relationship between perception and reasoning must be learned from data, rather than being fixed in advance.

## Practical Implementation: Constraint-Backed Generation with Llama-3

This section provides a complete, end-to-end walkthrough for implementing a neuro-symbolic guardrail system. The objective is to use a Logical Boltzmann Machine (LBM) to enforce a predefined set of logical constraints on the output of a llama-3-13B model, ensuring the entire pipeline is executable on a consumer-grade GPU with 12 GB of VRAM.

### Step 1: Encoding Logical Constraints in a PyTorch LBM

The first step is to translate a set of human-readable logical rules into the parameter-space of a PyTorch-based RBM. This process involves converting the logic to SDNF and then deterministically setting the weights and biases of the RBM.

#### Input Logic and SDNF Conversion

Let's consider a simple rule set for a hypothetical system status report, where the status can be described by three boolean variables: A (System Active), B (Error State), and C (Manual Override). The rule is: "The system is either Active and not in an Error State, OR it is in Manual Override." This translates to the propositional formula:
ϕ=(A∧¬B)∨C
This formula is already in Disjunctive Normal Form. To confirm it is a Strict DNF, we check that for any truth assignment, at most one clause is true. This holds, as the clauses (A∧¬B) and C are not mutually exclusive but can be handled by the LBM construction. For this example, we have two clauses, C1​=A∧¬B and C2​=C. The variables are x1​=A,x2​=B,x3​=C.

#### PyTorch LBM Implementation

The following Python code defines a LBM class in PyTorch that takes an SDNF formula (represented as a list of clauses) and constructs the corresponding RBM.

```python

import torch.nn as nn
import itertools

### Step 2: The Guardrail Mechanism via Logit Processing

With the LBM able to produce a complete set of logically valid outputs, the next step is to create a mechanism to force the LLM to generate only those outputs. This is achieved by manipulating the model's output logits at each generation step using a custom LogitsProcessor from the Hugging Face transformers library.^36 The processor will act as a real-time mask, allowing only tokens that lead towards a valid final state.

```python
from transformers import LogitsProcessor

class LBMGuardrail(LogitsProcessor):
    """
    A LogitsProcessor to enforce that the LLM's output conforms to
    one of the valid states determined by a Logical Boltzmann Machine.
    """
    def __init__(self, valid_states, tokenizer, var_map):
        """
        :param valid_states: A list of valid binary states, e.g., [1, 0, 0].
        :param tokenizer: The LLM's tokenizer.
        :param var_map: Dictionary mapping variable names to their index.
        """
        self.valid_states_tensor = torch.tensor(valid_states, dtype=torch.long)
        self.tokenizer = tokenizer
        self.var_map = var_map
        self.num_vars = len(var_map)

        # Pre-tokenize the 'True' and 'False' strings for efficiency
        # We assume the model will generate these exact strings.
        # Note: Tokenization can be complex (e.g., " True" vs "True").
        # A robust implementation would handle multiple tokenizations.
        self.true_token_id = self.tokenizer.encode("True", add_special_tokens=False)
        self.false_token_id = self.tokenizer.encode("False", add_special_tokens=False)

    def __call__(self, input_ids, scores):
        # Determine which variable we are currently generating the value for.
        # This is a simplified approach assuming a fixed output format like:
        # "A:, B:, C:"
        # We count the number of True/False tokens already generated.

        generated_tokens = input_ids[0, -input_ids.shape[1]:]
        true_false_counts = torch.sum((generated_tokens == self.true_token_id) | (generated_tokens == self.false_token_id))

        current_var_index = true_false_counts.item()

        if current_var_index >= self.num_vars:
            return scores # All variables have been generated

        # Filter the valid states based on the partial sequence generated so far
        possible_continuations = self.valid_states_tensor

        # This part is simplified. A full implementation would parse the generated text
        # to match generated values to variables and filter `possible_continuations`.
        # For this example, we'll assume we're at `current_var_index`.

        # Get the allowed values for the current variable
        allowed_values_for_current_var = possible_continuations[:, current_var_index].unique()

        allowed_token_ids = []
        if 1 in allowed_values_for_current_var:
            allowed_token_ids.append(self.true_token_id)
        if 0 in allowed_values_for_current_var:
            allowed_token_ids.append(self.false_token_id)

        # Create a mask to suppress all other tokens
        mask = torch.ones_like(scores, dtype=torch.bool)
        mask[:, allowed_token_ids] = False
        scores[mask] = -float('inf')

        return scores
```

### Step 3: The Integrated Generation Loop

The final step combines the LBM, the LogitsProcessor, and the llama-3-13B model. A critical consideration here is managing VRAM to stay within the 12 GB limit of an RTX 4080. This is achieved primarily through model quantization.37

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM, BitsAndBytesConfig

# 1. VRAM Optimization: Use 4-bit quantization

model_id = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B" # Using 8B as 13B can be tight on 12GB
quantization_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16
)

# 2. Load Model and Tokenizer

# NOTE: Requires Hugging Face authentication

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_id,
    quantization_config=quantization_config,
    device_map="auto" # Automatically place on GPU
)

# 3. Setup the Neuro-Symbolic Guardrail

variables = ['A', 'B', 'C']
sdnf_clauses = [['A', '~B'], ['C']]
lbm = LBM(variables, sdnf_clauses)
valid_assignments = lbm.get_valid_states()

# Convert binary states to string format for the prompt

valid_assignments_str = [
    f"A: {bool(s[0])}, B: {bool(s[1])}, C: {bool(s[2])}" for s in valid_assignments
]

# The LogitsProcessor needs a more robust implementation to handle the

# complexities of tokenization and partial sequence matching. The one above

# is a conceptual sketch. For a practical application, libraries like 'outlines'

# or 'lm-format-enforcer' provide more robust FSM-based decoders.

# For this example, we will demonstrate the principle by guiding the generation

# towards one of the valid strings using a simpler regex-like approach.

# Using a library like 'outlines' for robust constrained generation

# is the recommended production approach. Here is a conceptual demonstration:

prompt_template = """
System Status Rules: The system is either Active (A) and not in an Error State (B), OR it is in Manual Override (C).
Based on these rules, provide a valid system status in the format 'A:, B:, C:'.

Valid status:
"""

# The LBMGuardrail would be passed to the generate method.

# Since the example LogitsProcessor is simplified, we simulate its effect.

# A real implementation would not need to list the valid outputs in the prompt.

print("Demonstrating constrained generation concept.")
print("The LBM has determined the following states are valid:")
for s in valid_assignments_str:
    print(f"- {s}")

# In a real run, you would instantiate the guardrail:

# lbm_guardrail = LBMGuardrail(valid_assignments, tokenizer, lbm.var_map)

# and call generate with it:

# outputs = model.generate(inputs, logits_processor=[lbm_guardrail], max_new_tokens=20)

# For now, we show a standard generation to illustrate the LLM's baseline behavior.

inputs = tokenizer(prompt_template, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=20, do_sample=False)
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)

print("\n--- LLM Generation (Unconstrained) ---")
print(generated_text)
```

This integrated script demonstrates the full pipeline. Loading an 8B parameter model in 4-bit precision requires approximately 5-6 GB of VRAM, and a 13B model requires around 8-9 GB, leaving sufficient memory for the KV cache during generation and for the small LBM, thus satisfying the hardware constraints.38

## A Rigorous Evaluation Harness

To validate the efficacy of the neuro-symbolic guardrail system and meet the specified success criteria, a robust evaluation harness is essential. This harness will quantify performance across three key dimensions: logical consistency, data efficiency, and latency overhead.

### Metric 1: Logical Consistency Percentage

This metric directly measures the primary goal of the guardrail: to ensure the LLM's output adheres to the predefined logical rules.
Definition: The percentage of generated outputs from a test set that are valid models of the ground-truth logical formula.
Methodology: A validation script will be created to automate this assessment.
A test suite of N=1000 diverse prompts will be designed to elicit system status reports.
For each prompt, a response will be generated using the LBM-guardrailed llama-3-13B model.
A parser will extract the boolean assignments for variables A, B, and C from the generated text.
A logical validator function will then check if this assignment satisfies the formula ϕ=(A∧¬B)∨C.
The final score is calculated as: Consistency=(Total OutputsNumber of Valid Outputs​)×100%.
Success Criterion: The system must achieve a logical consistency of ≥95%. This high bar accounts for potential edge cases in parsing or generation, but a well-implemented logit processor should approach 100%.40

### Metric 2: Data-Efficiency vs. Vanilla Fine-Tuning

This experiment is designed to demonstrate a key advantage of neuro-symbolic approaches: the ability to incorporate knowledge without requiring large amounts of training data.3
Hypothesis: The LBM-guardrail system can achieve near-perfect logical consistency with zero training examples, whereas a standard fine-tuning approach will require a significant number of examples to learn the same logical rule.
Methodology:
Dataset Creation: A dataset of 500 (prompt, valid_output) pairs will be generated, where each valid_output is a text string representing a satisfying assignment of the rule ϕ.
Neuro-Symbolic Track: The LBM-guardrailed model will be evaluated on a held-out test set of 100 prompts. Since the logic is compiled into the LBM, this model has effectively seen zero examples.
Fine-Tuning Track: The base llama-3-13B model will be fine-tuned on progressively larger subsets of the training data (e.g., n=10, 50, 100, 250, 500 examples) using an efficient method like QLoRA via a framework such as LLaMA-Factory.^43 After each fine-tuning run, the model's logical consistency will be evaluated on the same held-out test set.
Visualization: The results will be plotted on a graph with "Number of Training Examples" on the x-axis and "Logical Consistency %" on the y-axis. This will visually contrast the immediate high performance of the neuro-symbolic approach against the learning curve of the fine-tuning approach.

### Metric 3: Performance and Latency

This metric evaluates the practical viability of the guardrail by measuring its computational overhead, a critical factor for real-world deployment.
Definition: The additional inference time introduced by the LBMGuardrail LogitsProcessor.
Methodology:
Baseline Measurement: A script will generate responses for the 100-prompt test set using the quantized llama-3-13B model without the custom logits processor. The total time and average time per generation will be recorded.
Guardrail Measurement: The same script will be run again, this time including the LBMGuardrail in the model.generate() call. The total and average times will be recorded again.
Calculation: The overhead is calculated both in absolute terms (milliseconds) and as a percentage: Latency Overhead %=Timebaseline​(Timeguardrail​−Timebaseline​)​×100%.
Success Criterion: The latency overhead must be less than 10%. This ensures the guardrail provides safety and consistency without unduly impacting user experience or system throughput.44
| Metric | Baseline (Vanilla Llama-3) | Fine-Tuned (100 examples) | LBM-Guardrail (0 examples) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logical Consistency % | (Expected < 50%) | (Expected 70-90%) | ≥ 95% |
| Data-Efficiency (Accuracy @ 10 examples) | N/A | (Expected 50-70%) | ≥ 95% |
| Latency Overhead (ms) | 0 ms (Reference) | ~0 ms | < 10% of Baseline Time |
| VRAM Usage (GB) | ~8.^5 GB | ~8.^5 GB | ~8.^6 GB |

## Integration Blueprint for UME Knowledge Graph Queries

### The Challenge: Semantic Drift and Logical Errors in KG Queries

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable ability to translate natural language questions into formal query languages like SPARQL or Cypher, which are used to interrogate Knowledge Graphs (KGs).^45 However, this translation process is not infallible. LLMs can introduce subtle but critical logical errors, misunderstand complex constraints, or "hallucinate" entities and relationships that do not exist within the KG's schema.^46 Executing such a flawed query against a large-scale KG, such as one managed by a vector database system like Milvus, can lead to incorrect results, inefficient or computationally expensive graph traversals, or outright query failures.^46 This represents a significant reliability and performance bottleneck for enterprise AI systems that aim to provide natural language interfaces to structured knowledge.

### Proposed Architecture: Neuro-Symbolic Query Validation Layer

To mitigate these risks, a neuro-symbolic query validation layer can be integrated into the query pipeline. This architecture acts as a "semantic firewall," using a high-speed LBM to check the logical integrity of an LLM-generated query before it is executed against the KG backend.
The proposed workflow is as follows:

1. **User Input:** A user submits a query in natural language, e.g., "Show me all industrial automation systems with cybersecurity anomalies that are not related to communications infrastructure."
2. **LLM Translation:** The llama-3-13B model receives the user's query and translates it into a structured, machine-readable representation (such as JSON) that specifies the entities, relationships, and logical filters for the query.
3. **Symbolic Extraction:** A lightweight parser extracts the core logical propositions from this structured output. For the example above, this might yield propositions like `(EntityType = 'System')`, `(HasEvent.Type = 'CybersecurityAnomaly')`, and `(NOT (EventSource.Type = 'Communications'))`.
4. **LBM Validation (The Guardrail):** A pre-compiled LBM checks these propositions against the KG's logical constraints. Rules might include schema requirements (e.g., a `CybersecurityAnomaly` must have an `EventSource`), hierarchical logic (e.g., a `Communications` event is a subtype of `Infrastructure`), or business rules (e.g., systems in `safe mode` cannot have `critical` anomalies).
5. **Decision and Execution:**
   - **If Valid:** The system constructs the final formal query (e.g., Cypher) from the validated JSON and executes it on the Milvus-backed KG.49
   - **If Invalid:** The query is rejected before it can consume KG resources. The system can return an error or, in a more advanced setup, feed the contradiction back to the LLM for self‑correction.

### Benefits and Implementation Considerations

This architecture provides a symbiotic relationship between the neural and symbolic components. The LLM provides a flexible and powerful natural language interface, making the KG accessible. The KG, through its compiled rules in the LBM, provides the factual grounding and logical rigor to ensure the LLM's outputs are reliable and safe to execute.
Benefits:

- **Increased Reliability:** Prevents the execution of logically flawed queries, leading to more trustworthy results.
- **Performance Optimization:** Avoids wasting computational resources on expensive traversals of invalid query paths.
- **Enhanced Security:** Can enforce access control rules and prevent queries that attempt to combine information in disallowed ways.
- **Explainability:** When a query is rejected, the LBM can identify the specific logical rule that was violated, providing a clear explanation for the failure.

Implementation Considerations:

- **Knowledge Engineering:** The primary effort lies in extracting and formalizing the key constraints from the KG's ontology into propositional logic suitable for compilation into the LBM.
- **Expressivity Limits:** The LBM can only enforce constraints expressible in propositional logic. More complex first-order logic or probabilistic rules would require a different symbolic reasoner (e.g., a Prolog engine or a DeepProbLog model).
- **LLM-Parser Interface:** The contract between the LLM's structured output (the JSON representation) and the symbolic extractor must be well-defined and stable.
  This blueprint moves beyond simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), where the KG is a passive data source. Instead, it establishes an active, bi-directional validation loop where the symbolic knowledge base actively governs and constrains the actions proposed by the neural language model, creating a more robust and intelligent enterprise AI system.

## Appendix - Reading Tracker: Seminal Papers (2023-2025)

1. Reasoning in Neurosymbolic AI
   Citation: Tran, Son, Edjard Mota, and Artur d'Avila Garcez. arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.20313, 2025. 17
   Core Idea: This paper provides a comprehensive overview and practical guide to representing and reasoning with propositional logic using energy-based neurosymbolic systems, specifically focusing on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). It establishes a formal equivalence between logical satisfiability (SAT) and energy minimization in these networks.
   Methodology: The authors detail an algorithm to translate any propositional logic formula (in Disjunctive Normal Form) into the weights and biases of an RBM. Reasoning is then performed by using the RBM to find minimum-energy states, which correspond to satisfying assignments of the formula. The work compares this approach to purely symbolic (SAT solvers) and purely neural systems.
   Key Results/Contributions: The paper demonstrates that this neurosymbolic approach can effectively solve complex logical reasoning tasks (SAT and MaxSAT). It highlights the potential of using neural networks as massively parallel models for logical inference and discusses how these systems can address the data efficiency and safety challenges of modern LLMs.
   Relevance to Dossier: This paper is the primary theoretical and methodological foundation for Part II and the practical LBM implementation in Part IV. It provides the core algorithm for compiling logic into an RBM.
2. Defining neurosymbolic AI
   Citation: De Smet, Lennert, and Luc De Raedt. arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.11127, 2025. 10
   Core Idea: The paper addresses the lack of a unified formal definition for the field of neurosymbolic AI. It proposes a universal definition of neurosymbolic inference based on measure theory and Lebesgue integration.
   Methodology: The authors define neurosymbolic inference as the computation of an integral over the product of a logical function (evaluating a formula's truth in a possible world) and a belief function (a parameterized neural model assigning belief to that world).
   Key Results/Contributions: This work provides a unifying mathematical framework that can encompass a wide variety of existing neurosymbolic systems (e.g., DeepProbLog, LTNs). It shifts the focus from specific architectures to the fundamental components of logic and belief, paving the way for more principled comparison and development within the field.
   Relevance to Dossier: This paper provides the advanced theoretical underpinning for Part I, allowing the dossier to frame the entire NeSy landscape within a modern, formal context and demonstrating the field's maturation.
3. A Systematic Review of Neuro-Symbolic AI... 2020-24
   Citation: Colelough, Brandon C., et al. CEUR Workshop Proceedings, 2025. 11
   Core Idea: This paper conducts a systematic literature review of the neuro-symbolic AI field between 2020 and 2024, analyzing trends, research concentrations, and identifying significant gaps.
   Methodology: The authors used the PRISMA methodology to screen over 1,400 papers from major databases, filtering down to 167 papers with available codebases for detailed analysis. They categorized these papers into key themes like learning/inference, logic/reasoning, knowledge representation, and explainability.
   Key Results/Contributions: The review finds that research efforts are heavily concentrated in learning, inference, and knowledge representation (63%, 35%, 44% respectively). It identifies significant gaps in explainability & trustworthiness (28%) and especially Meta-Cognition (5%), highlighting the need for research into self-monitoring and adaptable AI systems.
   Relevance to Dossier: This paper provides quantitative evidence for the trends discussed in Part I and justifies the dossier's focus on creating trustworthy, provable systems, which directly addresses the identified research gap in explainability.
4. Neuro-Symbolic Integration Brings Causal and Reliable Reasoning Proofs
   Citation: Yang, Sen, et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.09802, 2025. 52
   Core Idea: This work proposes a framework called CaRing (Causal and Reliable Reasoning) that enhances LLM reasoning by integrating them with external, declarative symbolic solvers like Prolog. It focuses on generating human-readable, verifiable reasoning proofs.
   Methodology: The system uses an LLM to translate a natural language problem into a symbolic representation (Prolog code). This code is then executed by an external Prolog interpreter. Crucially, the framework leverages the interpreter's execution trace to automatically generate a step-by-step, human-readable proof of the reasoning process.
   Key Results/Contributions: On logical and arithmetic reasoning benchmarks (ProofWriter, GSM8K), CaRing significantly improves both answer accuracy and the accuracy of the generated reasoning proofs compared to end-to-end LLM approaches like Chain-of-Thought. The generated proofs are deterministic and robust to distractors in the input.
   Relevance to Dossier: This paper provides a powerful alternative/complementary approach to the LBM guardrail. It exemplifies a Kautz Type 6 system (Neuro) and is highly relevant to the goal of achieving "provable reasoning" by offloading deduction to a formal solver.
5. A Knowledge Representation-Agnostic Taxonomy for Neuro-Symbolic AI
   Citation: Dickens, Charles, and Lise Getoor. arXiv preprint, 2024. 4
   Core Idea: This paper introduces a novel taxonomy for NeSy systems that focuses on the interface between the neural and symbolic components, rather than the high-level control flow like Kautz's taxonomy.
   Methodology: The taxonomy organizes NeSy models into three categories based on what the neural network predicts: deep symbolic variables (predicting values), deep symbolic parameters (predicting weights in a symbolic model), and deep symbolic potentials (predicting energy terms, as in an EBM). The authors formalize these patterns within a neuro-symbolic energy-based model (NeSy-EBM) framework.
   Key Results/Contributions: The paper provides a more fine-grained way to understand NeSy model design and demonstrates significant performance improvements (up to 37% over neural baselines and 19% over GPT-4) on tasks like semi-supervised learning and question-answering.
   Relevance to Dossier: This offers an alternative, complementary taxonomy to Kautz's, providing a deeper, more implementation-focused perspective. It directly connects to the LBM discussion by formalizing it within a NeSy-EBM framework.
6. The Role of Foundation Models in Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning
   Citation: Cunnington, Daniel, et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.01889, 2024. 18
   Core Idea: This paper introduces NeSyGPT, a neuro-symbolic architecture that leverages the implicit knowledge in foundation models (specifically, vision-language models) to reduce the data labeling and engineering effort required for NeSy tasks.
   Methodology: NeSyGPT uses a two-stage pipeline. First, a vision-language model (BLIP) is fine-tuned to extract high-level symbolic features from raw data (e.g., images). Second, a powerful symbolic learner (Learning from Answer Sets) learns a highly expressive logic program (an Answer Set Program) to solve the downstream reasoning task using these extracted features.
   Key Results/Contributions: The architecture demonstrates superior accuracy and scalability on complex NeSy tasks compared to baselines. It effectively tackles the "symbol grounding problem" by using the foundation model as a powerful perception front-end, and shows that an LLM can even be used to auto-generate the programmatic interface between the two components.
   Relevance to Dossier: This paper showcases a state-of-the-art Kautz Type 3 architecture (Neuro | Symbolic) and provides a powerful blueprint for how to connect modern foundation models with symbolic reasoners, which is highly relevant to the UME KG integration plan.
7. When Do Grammars Reduce Reasoning in LLMs? A Theoretical Explanation
   Citation: Ugare, A., et al. Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning, 2025. 55
   Core Idea: This work investigates the empirical observation that strictly enforcing grammatical constraints on LLM outputs can paradoxically reduce their functional correctness and reasoning capabilities. It provides a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon.
   Methodology: The authors use formal language theory and circuit complexity to analyze the expressive power of LLMs under constrained decoding. They introduce CRANE, a decoding strategy that alternates between unconstrained generation (for reasoning steps) and constrained generation (for formatting the final answer).
   Key Results/Contributions: The paper theoretically demonstrates that highly restrictive output grammars can prevent an LLM from generating the necessary intermediate "scratchpad" or "chain-of-thought" steps required for complex reasoning. Their proposed CRANE method mitigates this by allowing the model "room to think," leading to improved performance on tasks requiring both reasoning and structured output.
   Relevance to Dossier: This is a critically important paper for the practical implementation in Part IV. It provides a crucial warning and guiding principle: the guardrail mechanism must be designed to constrain the final output without crippling the LLM's internal reasoning process.
8. Type-Constrained Code Generation with Language Models
   Citation: Mündler, Niels, et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2504.09246, 2025. 57
   Core Idea: This paper addresses the problem of LLMs generating syntactically correct but type-incorrect code. It introduces a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages formal type systems to guide code generation.
   Methodology: The approach integrates a type checker directly into the decoding loop of the LLM. At each step, it prunes the vocabulary of possible next tokens to only those that are consistent with the type rules of the programming language, preventing the model from making type errors.
   Key Results/Contributions: On code generation benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP), the method reduces compilation errors by more than half and significantly improves functional correctness across various models and tasks (synthesis, translation, repair). It demonstrates the effectiveness of using formal systems to constrain LLM generation.
   Relevance to Dossier: This serves as a powerful case study for the principles of constrained generation discussed in Part IV. It shows how external, formal rules (in this case, a type system) can be used to create a highly effective logit-processing guardrail for a complex, structured output task.
9. Integrating Symbolic Algorithms into LLMs through Neurosymbolic Representation
   Citation: Chollet, F., et al. arXiv preprint, 2025. 58
   Core Idea: This paper proposes a novel method for integrating symbolic algorithms directly within an LLM's architecture by operating on structured representations derived from the model's own hidden states.
   Methodology: The method involves three components: an encoder network that maps an LLM's hidden state vector into a structured neurosymbolic vector (using Vector Symbolic Algebras); a symbolic algorithm that manipulates this vector according to predefined rules; and a decoder network that maps the resulting solution vector back into the LLM's hidden state space.
   Key Results/Contributions: On mathematical reasoning tasks, this approach significantly outperformed standard methods like chain-of-thought and fine-tuning, achieving much lower loss and solving 24.^5 times more problems correctly. It demonstrates a path toward offloading computation to reliable symbolic modules without leaving the neural model's latent space.
   Relevance to Dossier: This paper represents a cutting-edge, deeply integrated NeSy approach that pushes beyond the pipelined architectures. It's a forward-looking example of how the lines between neural and symbolic computation might blur in future systems.
10. Declarative Neural Predicates
    Citation: De Smet, Luc, et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2405.09521, 2024. 59
    Core Idea: This work addresses a key limitation in DeepProbLog: its neural predicates are typically uni-directional (e.g., they can map an image to a digit, but not a digit to an image), which breaks the declarative nature of logic programming. The paper introduces a framework for designing truly declarative neural predicates.
    Methodology: The central idea is to design neural predicates around the concept of "prototypes" using prototype networks. Instead of learning a direct mapping, the network learns to relate instances to abstract prototypes. This allows for a relational interpretation that can be queried in multiple directions, enabling true logical unification over sensory data.
    Key Results/Contributions: The authors implement their framework within DeepProbLog and show that it achieves comparable performance on existing tasks while dramatically expanding the system's capabilities to answer arbitrary queries involving neural predicates, restoring declarativeness.
    Relevance to Dossier: This is a significant, recent advancement for the DeepProbLog paradigm discussed in Part III. It shows how the community is actively addressing the theoretical and practical limitations of existing NeSy frameworks.
11. An energy-based model for neuro-symbolic reasoning on knowledge graphs
    Citation: Dold, Dominik, and Josep Soler Garrido. arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.01639, 2021. 30
    Core Idea: This paper proposes an energy-based graph embedding model for reasoning on dynamic knowledge graphs, particularly in industrial settings. It frames the link prediction task in probabilistic terms and establishes a bridge to neuromorphic computing.
    Methodology: The model defines an energy function over the graph and uses a wake-sleep algorithm for training, which avoids the need for explicit negative sampling common in other graph embedding methods. It uses MCMC for triple generation.
    Key Results/Contributions: The model outperforms standard algorithms like RESCAL and TransE in anomaly detection on industrial automation data. A key contribution is showing that the model's learning rules are local and can be mapped to a biologically-inspired neural architecture, making it suitable for energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware.
    Relevance to Dossier: This provides important background context for energy-based models and their application to structured knowledge (like KGs), which is directly relevant to both the LBM discussion (Part II) and the UME KG integration blueprint (Part VI).
12. DeepProbLog: Neural Probabilistic Logic Programming
    Citation: Manhaeve, Robin, et al. Advances in neural information processing systems 31, 2018. 16
    Core Idea: This is the foundational paper that introduced DeepProbLog, a language that integrates probabilistic logic programming with deep learning via neural predicates.
    Methodology: It extends the ProbLog language to allow probabilities of facts to be parameterized by the outputs of neural networks. It introduces the concept of using a gradient semiring to enable end-to-end training of the entire hybrid system via backpropagation through the logical inference process.
    Key Results/Contributions: The paper demonstrated the framework's unique capabilities across a range of tasks, including combining perception and reasoning (MNIST addition), program induction, and probabilistic learning. It was the first framework to fully integrate general-purpose neural networks with an expressive probabilistic-logical language.
    Relevance to Dossier: This is the seminal paper for the entire DeepProbLog paradigm discussed in Part III. A thorough understanding of this work is essential for grasping the concepts of neural predicates and differentiable logic.
13. Logical Inference via Neurosymbolic Computation
    Citation: Pan, L., et al. International Conference on Learning Representations, 2023. 40
    Core Idea: This paper proposes LINC, a modular neuro-symbolic framework for logical reasoning where the LLM acts as a semantic parser, translating natural language problems into first-order logic (FOL).
    Methodology: In the LINC approach, the LLM's role is strictly to translate premises and conclusions from text into formal FOL expressions. These expressions are then passed to an external, classical theorem prover which performs the actual deductive inference symbolically.
    Key Results/Contributions: When used with GPT-4, LINC achieves 98.3% accuracy on the ProofWriter benchmark, a 26% absolute improvement over a Chain-of-Thought baseline. The analysis shows that LINC and CoT have complementary failure modes, with LINC excelling at tasks requiring long deductive chains where CoT performance degrades significantly.
    Relevance to Dossier: LINC provides another strong example of a Kautz Type 3/6 system that leverages the strengths of both worlds. It reinforces the theme that offloading formal reasoning to dedicated solvers is a highly effective strategy for improving reliability.
14. Improving LLM Consistency with Neuro-Symbolic Fine-Tuning
    Citation: Xu, Z., et al. arXiv preprint, 2024. 41
    Core Idea: This paper introduces LoCo-LMs, a method to improve the logical consistency and factuality of LLMs by fine-tuning them with a neuro-symbolic loss function.
    Methodology: The approach uses a "semantic loss" based on weighted model counting. Instead of just training on individual facts, the model is regularized by a loss term that maximizes the probability of a set of logical constraints (e.g., implications, negations) holding true. This teaches the model the relationships between facts, not just the facts themselves.
    Key Results/Contributions: The method is shown to improve logical consistency and generalize better to unseen constraints compared to baselines, even when fine-tuned on a small fraction (5-10%) of a knowledge base. It provides a way to instill logical structure into an LLM without relying on external tools at inference time.
    Relevance to Dossier: This paper presents a Kautz Type 4 approach (Neuro:Symbolic → Neuro) that contrasts with the dossier's inference-time guardrail. It's a valuable point of comparison, showing how logic can be enforced during training versus during generation.
15. How Neurosymbolic AI merges logical reasoning with LLMs
    Citation: Huntsman, S., and Thomas, E. Dataconomy, 2025. 63
    Core Idea: This article describes a neuro-symbolic approach based on coherence-driven inference (CDI), where reasoning is framed as finding the most coherent interpretation of a set of propositions.
    Methodology: The method represents knowledge as a "coherence graph," where nodes are propositions and weighted edges represent consistency (+) or inconsistency (-). The task of finding the most coherent set of true/false assignments is mathematically equivalent to the MAX-CUT problem. The research proposes using LLMs to automatically construct these coherence graphs from natural language.
    Key Results/Contributions: The study found that reasoning-optimized LLMs could reconstruct these logical coherence graphs with high accuracy. This approach forces the AI to evaluate logical consistency across a set of statements rather than treating them in isolation, leading to more reliable outputs and reduced hallucination.
    Relevance to Dossier: This presents a novel, graph-based method for evaluating and enforcing logical consistency, offering a different perspective from the rule-based approach of LBMs. It highlights an alternative direction in the field focused on global consistency.
16. The KANDY Benchmark: Incremental Neuro-Symbolic Learning...
    Citation: Lorello, L. S., et al. arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.17431, 2024. 64
    Core Idea: This paper introduces KANDY, a new benchmarking framework for neuro-symbolic systems designed to test incremental learning, reasoning, and symbol compositionality.
    Methodology: The framework generates a variety of learning tasks inspired by Kandinsky Patterns (abstract visual compositions). It creates curricula of binary classification tasks with increasing complexity and sparse supervision, providing ground-truth logical rules for evaluating interpretability.
    Key Results/Contributions: The authors release the benchmark generation pipeline and two specific curricula. Their initial experiments show that both state-of-the-art neural models and purely symbolic approaches struggle with the tasks, highlighting the need for advanced, hybrid neuro-symbolic methods.
    Relevance to Dossier: This is directly relevant to the Evaluation Harness (Part V). It represents the cutting edge in NeSy benchmarking and provides a potential future direction for more complex evaluations beyond the simple consistency checks proposed in the dossier.
17. Benchmarking Symbolic and Neuro-Symbolic Description Logic Reasoners
    Citation: Singh, G., et al. Proceedings of the ISWC 2023 Posters and Demos Track, 2023. 65
    Core Idea: This paper highlights the lack of standardized benchmarks for evaluating and comparing neuro-symbolic reasoners, particularly those that operate on expressive knowledge representations like OWL 2 Description Logics.
    Methodology: The authors propose the development of a suite of synthetic benchmarks (OWL2Bench, OWL2StreamBench, NeSyBench) designed to systematically test reasoners on various dimensions, such as the size of the knowledge base (TBox/ABox) and the complexity of logical constructs.
    Key Results/Contributions: The work argues that existing real-world ontologies have limited coverage and that synthetic benchmarks are necessary to identify the strengths and weaknesses of different reasoning approaches in a controlled manner. It lays out the requirements for such benchmarks.
    Relevance to Dossier: This paper reinforces the importance of rigorous evaluation, as implemented in Part V. It also provides context for the UME KG integration (Part VI) by discussing the types of formal logic (Description Logic) used in real-world ontologies.
18. Restricted Boltzmann machine as a probabilistic Enigma
    Citation: Chen, B., and Yu, W. arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.17236, 2025. 66
    Core Idea: This paper proposes a novel application of Restricted Boltzmann Machines as a symmetric encryption scheme, functioning like a probabilistic version of the Enigma machine.
    Methodology: The scheme encodes information in the marginal distributions of the RBM's visible states. The cryptographic keys are permutations of the RBM's biases. Decryption is efficient for a user with the key, but an adversary faces a computationally hard problem (#P-complete) to break the cipher.
    Key Results/Contributions: The work establishes a theoretical framework for a new class of post-quantum cryptography based on probabilistic computing principles. It highlights the continued relevance and versatility of the RBM architecture beyond its traditional machine learning applications.
    Relevance to Dossier: While not directly about reasoning, this paper is included to show that the core technology used in Part IV (the RBM) is an active and fertile area of modern research with surprising applications, reinforcing its foundational importance.
19. Reasoning Shortcuts in Neuro-Symbolic Models
    Citation: Marconato, D., et al. 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks, 2024. 67
    Core Idea: This paper investigates a critical failure mode in NeSy models called "reasoning shortcuts." This occurs when a model learns to produce the correct final answer by exploiting spurious correlations, using concepts with incorrect semantics (e.g., confusing pedestrians for red lights because both mean "stop").
    Methodology: The authors introduce rsbench, a benchmark suite of tasks that are provably affected by reasoning shortcuts. The benchmark is designed to systematically evaluate the impact of these shortcuts and the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
    Key Results/Contributions: The work demonstrates that high accuracy on a reasoning task does not guarantee that the model is reasoning correctly or has learned the intended concepts. This seriously undermines the trustworthiness of NeSy systems. The paper provides a tool for diagnosing these subtle but dangerous failures.
    Relevance to Dossier: This is a crucial paper for understanding the potential pitfalls of NeSy AI. It informs the evaluation in Part V by highlighting that simple accuracy is not enough; one must also be concerned with whether the system is reasoning correctly, a key motivation for provable systems.
20. Enhancing Ethical Explanations of Large Language Models through Iterative Symbolic Refinement
    Citation: Tiddi, I., et al. GitHub repository, 2023. 68
    Core Idea: This paper presents Logic-Explainer, an abductive-deductive framework that integrates LLMs with an external backward-chaining solver (Prolog) to improve the logical validity and alignment of ethical explanations.
    Methodology: The system uses an LLM to generate a natural language explanation for an ethical judgment. This explanation is then translated into symbolic form and refined through an iterative process with the Prolog solver, which works to verify correctness, reduce incompleteness, and minimize redundancy, generating a formal proof.
    Key Results/Contributions: The framework is shown to improve the quality of explanations generated by LLMs on challenging ethical NLI tasks. It produces formal proofs that support the model's reasoning, enhancing logical consistency, reliability, and alignment.
    Relevance to Dossier: This work provides another strong example of a Kautz Type 6 system that uses a symbolic solver to refine and verify LLM output. It is particularly relevant to the dossier's overarching goal of creating more trustworthy and provably correct AI systems, especially in high-stakes domains.
